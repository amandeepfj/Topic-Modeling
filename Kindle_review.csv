"B0051VVOB2","5","I love the graphics first of all. I love that I have all my books that I want to read right at my finger tips. I would not trade my fire for any other tablet. This is a must have'!!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Love my Kindle Fire, had to buy one for a friend and am planning on getting one for my son as he ventures off to school! Would recommend this product for those who want something different that the normal pc life!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I bought the Fire as a Christmas present to myself. I had some second thoughts after reading some of the negative reviews. I held off until Christmas to unwrap the package and I couldn't have been more surprised. The Fire has operated as promised. Too many reviewers tried to compare the Fire with an IPAD, which it is not. It is exactly what Amazon advertised. I find the Silk browser to be as fast as IE 8 on my desktop, the display is awesome, steaming content plays without interruption, and using the Fire is intuitive. As promised the Fire is a media consumption device with the added ability to access the internet and email. It allows me avoid booting up my desktop just for a quick email check or web search. I am sure there are more apps that I could install, but so far everything that I want or think I need has been available--including Angry Birds. There are still features I haven't used, such as the Cloud, but as time goes on I expect the Fire will handle them seemlessly. The only thing I find even a bit disappointing is a rather narrow selection of free media on Prime. The hype with Prime was there were thousands of free video and text available. I am sure there are if one was to count, but the question is how many of them would a consumer really want to view or read.  All in all the Fire is a great buy and I will most likely purchase a second one for my wife."
"B0051VVOB2","5","If you read at all you need a Kindle. It is easy to use, words big enough to where you don't have a problem reading in any situation. Amazon has enough Free stuff( if you join Prime) to keep you reading forever. Down loading games for the most part are cheep, if not free. and the books are cheap and a bunch of free ones.<br /><br />It is real comfortable to hold, in a plane, car , in bed at night ,or sitting in your favorite chair or if you prefer standing up in line at an airport,"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I have both an iPad and a kindle fire. They both have their places. The fire does exactly what was advertised, no need to bash it for being a value oriented tablet.  I think the fire is going to be great for traveling thanks to its small size and light weight. There are a few quirks with the software but this is common with a brand new device.  The default news stand view is a little annoying  it would be nice to be able to customize the main interface.  This does however keep the device better organized than the iPad.  If the amazon app store expands and they bring instant videos to PS3 it will really help the case for amazon's tablet market."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I bought the Kindle Fire for my husband who has routinely co-opted my Xoom for over a year.  I have to say, I might have to start stealing his Fire from time to time.<br /><br />It's smaller than I'm used to (7\\"" vs. 10\\"") and lighter by far.  The interface is easy to negotiate (a little too easy for my liking with the carousel, but my husband is good with it), and the whole device is much more snappy than I expected.  I'm really impressed with the video streaming!  The resolution is much better than I thought, and it streamed just like my more costly tablet without any problems or weird buffering.<br /><br />That said, I don't like it much for reading.  I much prefer E-ink to the backlit screen, which is the case with my Xoom, too.  As others have mentioned, I haven't yet figured out how to get the page numbers/progress meter to reliably show, which is a little vexing, but not a huge deal for me."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I had to return this product since it was too complicated to put together and I did not really like it."
"B0051VVOB2","1","DO NOT buy this device. I have had it for about 1 month & have had way to many problems with it locking up & having to hard shut it to restart. Now is isn't even holding a charge & won't even turn on. I repeat O NOT buy this item."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I wasn't sure about buying this for my 8 year old daughter.  I am happy that I did.  She loves to read and this has encouraged her to read even more.  She doesn't leave the house without the Kindle Fire.  I do wish there were more library titles to choose from.  I use it for email and facebook instead of the laptop.  We have had it for almost a month and love it."
"B0051VVOB2","1","Every time I go to use mine, the battery is dead.  It locks up all the time also.  It takes a long time to turn on.  It's gets really hot when it's charging.  On the bright side, it makes a nice paperweight.  Failure product, waste of money."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This product, Kindle Fire, was purchased by my husband for my Christmas present.  It is an easy item to get great games, books, etc.  I am so happy with my Kindle and take it everywhere I go."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I have thoroughly enjoyed my Kindle Fire since it arrived in Nov. It has taken over a ton of the duties my Android phone once had to do. I am very happy with it.  The screen size is perfect and it is light enough to be easy to use for an extended amount of time.   The Fire appstore does not have as many applications on it as the Google market.  I have found that a lot of the apps not yet on the amazon appstore work completely fine.  Wish the app venders would catch up and get their apps loaded onto the appstore. So many of them work perfectly on the Fire.    The media infrastructure was the killer-app for me. I have wanted a highly mobile device that I could watch Netflix, Amazon Videos, and my own personal media server media on. I hated having to pull out the laptop to do this.  Now I can access all three from this one tablet. Superb. Amazon Video on the Fire is oustanding quality.  Netflix is very good too, though Amazon obviously knew how to get the most out of the Fire for their own purposes.   I use my Kindle Fire for everything except my primary reading device.  I still prefer the e-ink Kindle Reader for my voluminous book reading. Loving all my Kindles.  The only issue I have seen with my Fire is that the audio appears to be messed up when plugged into a external sound system.  It has a ferocious hiss that may require me to contact customer service to fix it. Problem doesn't arise when listening through the internal speakers.  Otherwise I am very happy with the Fire. Great price, great function.  Couldn't be happier."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Before purchasing the Kindle Fire, I had been using a Samsung Galaxy Tab. I bought my wife the Kindle Fire for her birthday and I was very impressed with its usefulness and utility. Aside from the fact that the Fire does not take photos, I am easily able to surf the web and use it as a replacement for my tab device. The electronic books are impossible to put down once you start reading them. There is something about the page format that is compelling to the reader and encourages you to keep reading. I am not certain why this is. You will have to be careful to turn the device off completely when not in use; otherwise, the batteries will run down quickly. Unlike my wife's original Kindle, this device does not have network access and can only be used with wi-fi. This trait is fine when you have easy access to wi-fi -- but, not so good if you are using it in a more remote location. I can also say that, when opening up web pages in the browser, the font is very small and can sometimes be difficult for older eyes to read. Enlarging the font or the page is possible, but then the page does not comfortably fit onto the screen. Overall, this is an excellent device and suits my needs perfectly."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I purchased 2 of these for my kids as an alternative to an iPad. While Santa hasn't delivered these yet, my initial impression is that Amazon has a lot of kinks to work out.  Pros: Brilliant color, quick access to primary functions that are very user friendly (books, video, music, etc). Whispersync is great as I hate having to manually sync my phone to my computer.  Cons: While a password can be required to unlock the Fire, there's no password required to make purchases through the tablet. That means kids can buy apps, movies, books and the like directly from your account without your knowledge or approval.   You know how you can buy DVDs and Blu Rays with a digital copy for a few dollars more? Yeah, you can't view those digital copies on your Fire. Fire only supports 2 file types and neither are defaults on those digital copies. So you have to either buy converter software and spend a lot of time converting those movies, or buy digital versions directly from Amazon which means you can't watch the movie anyplace else unless you can hook up your computer to your TV. If you choose to convert your movies they must be manually moved to the Fire (you'll need to buy a micro USB cable and hook up to your computer - Whispersync won't help you here), then those videos won't be in the video tab, they'll be in the Gallery which is a pain to find, and the videos won't be labeled.   These two cons are pretty big for me and if it weren't so close to Christmas I'd return these and get something else."
"B0051VVOB2","1","A media reader/viewer without volume controls? Come on! The touchscreen is not very sensitive - very laggy performance. I love the compact size and light heft of a 7-inch tablet, but  I'm waiting for the next version."
"B0051VVOB2","5","The Kindle Fire is no monster-storage powerhouse, but it functions just as it is described and I have loved it as an e-book reader, as a web browser/media device, and as a place to use apps.   The aforementioned order is in line with its strengths with E-book reader being the strongest selling point followed by being a web browser and an app device.   The Fire does most things correctly. The E-reader is usable and fast without that blasted blinking that happens with the regular Kindles. It works very smooth for reading novels. The web browsing and Email are very well designed for the device and have a nice feature that increases speed. Amazon allows the Kindle to process some back-end data on its servers (the cloud) which helps speed up Internet access even when you don't have the best connection. Apps are only as good as the developers. Angry Birds runs perfectly, as well as those made from other well known phone app developers. An issue that has arisen is that since there are less apps (as of the moment) than on regular phone app stores the crappy ones stand out more. There are also less apps in general which will turn some people off.   The biggest flaw is the memory situation. ~6.5 gigs of usable space is a deterrent to many (considering there is no micro SD slot). This is not that bad if you mainly want the device for books and internet as I do. I will put choice songs or albums on the device, but I have never been much for watching movies on the go. I use the device as a way to pick it up for a quick read and then get back to work (at which point I can use it to check email, etc.) The battery only lasts for about 8 hours of use, but that is expected for a tablet and is not a deterrent to use if you are someone who is at home or at the office for long spans of time.   Overall, this device is meant to be bought for reading books and web browsing smoothly and accurately and with all the other features as cool/quality perks. (IMO)"
"B0051VVOB2","3","The kindle fire is compact and dazzling but the size means you'll want to use it one handed.  It's TOO heavy for one handed use for very long.  The touch is perfect for one handed.  Feather light.  These purchases were for my wife so weight is important.  It's an ereader, not an iPad.  (Amazon states that about the Fire also).  The iPad is heaver but the size is ideal for 2 handed use or in a lap.  I hope Apple doesn't create a smaller iPad as I'm sure it would have the same problem."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I've used both the iPad and the Fire.  In my opinion, the Fire is not a direct competitor to the iPad.  The Fire lets me do what I want quickly and easily.  Great apps, email, browsing are all easily done.  I have read comments from some so-called \\""usability\\"" experts complaining about the size of the touch screen and fat fingering input.  Well, it's a 7 inch screen.  Smaller than the iPad...it will be more compact.  I wonder what qualifies one as a uasbility expert, anyway?<br /><br />That being said, the device won't please everyone.  If you are looking for a computer replacement, you will be disappointed.  So far, my books, magazines, movies, music and apps run well.  It has exceeded expectations.  Measure the device against intended use, and not wishful thinking.<br /><br />EDIT:  I want to make sure that I include my hands on experience with the Fire, as many of the negative reviews fail to do so.  I've owned Kindles in one form or another since version one.  This is a different machine altogether.  I use it every day for reading, videos, email, work and applications (mostly games).  I have not had any significant interface issues.  Yes, there are times that you need to press more than once on the touch screen.  But I've had this issue with other touch screen devices, and given some experience you learn how to touch the screen (firm press for about 2 seconds) to get it to work.  Browsing is more than adequate.  Is it comparable to my desktop computer?  No.  But I don't expect it to be.  However, it is sufficient to let me browse what I want, where I want, and when I want.  It is fast enough, and I have not had any issues with speed that I consider out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Now, for the button issues.  First, I am happy there is no volume button on the outside of the unit.  One less thing to hit and adjust while holding the Fire.  It is a simple screen touch to bring the volume up.  As for the power button, I've never hit it accidentally.  I don't know why this is an issue for some.  I handle my Fire in a case, and outside the case as well, and I have never turned off the Fire accidentally.<br /><br />The app store has all that I want.  I have side-loaded a few apps that I use on my Android phone to the Fire that aren't in the Kindle App store (Yahoo Fantasy Football, for example).  You can do that by saving the executable file to your computer and loading to the Fire.  There are instructions all over the net to do it. However, I find the selection of apps to be sufficient, and I have no issues with the store.  I understand Amazon's desire to limit the number of apps available and to have some control over their ecosystem.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic product for me.  So much so that I'm giving my iPad 2 to my son.  Just don't need it anymore.<br /><br />PS...typed on my Fire.this is an issue for some.

"B0051VVOB2","4","To be perfect, Kindle only need to add a microphone and you got all in one!!! I got my Kindle Fire this Christmas and I simply love it."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I actually received the Kindle Fire as a gift from my husband. The first thing I noticed was the weight of it. At first it felt a little too heavy but after a while your wrist stops hurting.  I mainly wanted this to read my books and it has its pros and cons<br />  The pros as an e-reader: very easy to add bookmarks, change pages, adjust the screen<br />  The cons as an e-reader: very heavy if you are used to the lightweight kindles and I was surprised the screen doesn't look the same. That was the hardest thing for me to get over was that it didn't look like all the other kindles. A little hard on the eyes at first but with you being able to adjust the screen color and brightness it gets better.<br />  Over all the kindle is awesome. I gave this five stars because of all the neat features. My magazines look breathtaking on this, the apps are really cool and actually most are the same as on my iphone. And, when it comes to surfing the net or visiting websites it is a lot faster than I had expected.<br />  All in all this was a great buy for an affordable price (well, little money from my husband's wallet) and I would highly recommend getting one.  The hard part now is trying to get my husband and one year old daughter away from my Kindle Fire!"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I was super excited to get my Kindle Fire and have been pleased with the games, books, and video. However, I was really looking forward to using the internet on my new Kindle since I currently use my iPhone for Internet access and the screen is just too tiny for extensive searches. I have been extremely disappointed with how SLOW the Internet is. I know it's not just my WiFi because the pages load twice as fast when I use my iPhone on the WiFi. I get so frustrated that I tend to just go back to my iPhone for Internet use which is frustrating since Internet access was one if the main reasons I got the Kindle. Other than that, I have been very pleased with my Kindle Fire."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love this thing. Never thought I'd like a kindle better than a book, but this is a VERY close second. I'm sorry I waited so long to get one."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I gave my husband this item for his birthday and he really likes it.  He couldn't wait to play with it and has already downloaded a book.  I have the Nook and am considering switching to the Kindle."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Love it...still getting use to using it but so far great for reading and watching movies. Have not tried the TV show part yet. I highly recommend you get a cover that can also be used as a stand, otherwise it does get heavy holding it while reading or watching a movie."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I was originally torn between the new Nook color and the Kindle Fire. As we have one Nook already in the house I wasn't sure I wanted another one. As Christmas drew near and the decision to choose my next e-reader weighed on my mind - I opted for the Kindle Fire, despite the negative criticism it has received and am very glad I did.   After reviewing the product and using it now for a week - I can say with confidence that the Kindle Fire has everything to make even the most skeptical consumer happy. I was just such a consumer and was almost mislead by the negative press. However, being an independent free thinker I chose the Amazon product because I love Amazon and consider myself an Amazon Nut! I The negative complaints about Kindle Fire are not justified in todays technologically advanced society. The touch screen volume control almost steered me toward the Nook --but truly has not been an issue at all as the touch screen volume control is conveniently located and that was a serius concern for me. I like the idea of a physical volume control on the side of Nook, but honestly I love the Fire so much it hasn't even had any impact on my use at all. The lack of external audio and video output, well lets face it, its an e-reader not a television, but I will say that I have indeed watched movies already on the Fire and love that feature, but I can access the same content through my computer, which can hook up to my TV, my cell phone and or my Nintendo Wii -- so why would I need to hook up my Kindle Fire to my TV? I don't know --seems like a silly, unnecessary additional expense if you ask me. The picture on the screen is amazing. The touch screen has sufficient sensors despite the negative reviews, I have had zero issues with the touchscreen --it works perfect. The security updates seem to be sufficient and password protection is available and should be used. The brightnss level is not an issue as i saw someme complaints about being too bright at night in bed, well if it is too bright even on its loewest setting then change the background from white to black - simple fix! The battery complaint had me truly worried, because a long lasting battery is necessary with such an item --but I keep my brightness turned down pretty low and I have used it for 3-4 hours straight playing games, downloading apps, watching movies, reading emails, and of course reading books and my battery has never drained itself. So I have no complaints with the battery life or brightness of the device. The Kindle Fire is so awesome I just love it.  In a nutshell --all the negative criticism in the weeks before Christmas had me worried, but I stuck with Amazons reputation for greatness and made that my single Christmas request this year. I was not and am not disappointed in the least. In fact most of the criticisms I read about don't hold water. The security issues \\""YES\\"" were critical, I agree, but they have been addressed, so if yu are considering the KINDLE FIRE I say GO for IT! I was very skeptical, but trusted the Amazon reputation and I have not been disappointed in the least. As a household with both a Nook Color and now a Kindle Fire I can honestly say I would choose the Kindle Fire again tomorrow over any other e-reader out there!  Thank you Amazon. What a great product!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love it!! It does everything I was expecting it to do.  It isn't an IPAD, if I had wanted an IPAD I would have bought an IPAD. My books are in vibrant color the video streaming is great.  I just downloaded Bon Apetit magazine and was very impressed with the pages and it looks just like the magazine is in my hand except magazines won't get piled up around the house.  The only draw back that I have is I wish it had 3G like my regular Kindle.  I want to be able to buy a book anywhere I'm at without having to hook up to someone else's or even my own wireless connection."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My husband is an avid reader and this was the perfect gift for him.  He has bad eyesight and you can change the font size and there is a light.  He can reader with the bedroom lights out.  He downloads hundreds of books so he does not have to go anywhere to get more material.  He loves it...."
"B0051VVOB2","3","I received my Kindle Fire about 3 weeks ago. I have yet to access it. I knew it had Wi-Fi built in but really wasn't sure how that worked. I don't have a wireless router at home so need to go somewhere to set it up or buy a wireless router, which is expensive and has to be set up in the home, which I know nothing about. I'm very frustrated and had I known what it entailed to get going on it, I might not have bought it."
"B0051VVOB2","1","Kindle Fire is useless outside US. You are not able to get any application nor movies or support even though you want to pay for them. Don't ever buy this product from AMAZON. I'm just disappointed of their policy. US ONLY???  WTF...  I'm not a big client, but they just lose one more."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Kindle Fire is great for what it is. It isn't an iPad.  It is a little buggy. But I remember the iPhone when it first came out. It was much more limited in its abilities and much more buggy. Upgrades straightened out many of the problems as I imagine they will with the Fire. It's a wonderful little device. I take it with me everywhere!"
"B0051VVOB2","2","i love its price....but it was slow and it felt like too much work. ive used an i pad and it was 10 times better. and no im not an apple fan. no i phone or mac's in my house. i wish the fire was better and love amazon as a service...but the fire was no worth it."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I will be the first to admit that I am a longtime Apple lover. I have had many generations of iPods, recently got my MacBook and my iPhone. Not to mention I have been lusting after the iPad since its introduction. I could not bring myself nor convince my husband to pay the steep price of $499 for a tablet. Enter the Kindle Fire. I received it as a Christmas gift and I instantly fell in love. Sure it doesn't have video or camera capability, but with all the smartphone technology these days is that really necessary for a tablet ? Not in my humble opinion. I'm a big reader and like to read multiple books at the same time - this works beautifully for that purpose. We went to the beach this past weekend for New Years and I read two books on the Kindle Fire this weekend. Absolutely wonderful !!! And it sure beats carrying around a stack of books that I may not get to thats for sure. Another great benefit of the Kindle vs the iPad is the HUGE selection on eBooks in the Kindle store. The majority of the times the prices in the Kindle store are competitive to the iBook store, if not cheaper sometimes.<br /><br />The battery life is impressive. I can go a few days without charging it, as long as I keep my activity low key like reading or checking email. Now playing angry birds for hours in a row like my husband did on New Years will drain the battery, so be warned :) !<br /><br />Another benefit is the apps are a lot cheaper in the Kindle store than they are in the iTunes App store. Plants vs Zombies will run you 4.99 in the iTunes store compared to $1.49 in the Kindle Store - one of many example.<br /><br />As far as the actual Kindle itself, its the size of a paperback novel so not too heavy. Its very simple to use, you can easily go back and forth between applications, books and the web. Email and web browsing are simple to use. The touch screen technology is great, with minor delays sometimes but usually not.<br /><br />If you are looking for a tablet thats not as steep as the iPad, dont necessarily need 3G, video or camera capability - this is the tablet for you. Highly recommended !deo or camera capability - this is the tablet for you. Highly recommended !"
"B0051VVOB2","5","This is my second Kindle and for me this is great since it is not as small as my smart phone and I can do almost the same thing (docs on the Kindle...pics on the phone).  I'm confined to bed for long periods and this has been wonderful for me since it is not as heavy as a laptop.  It does everything and more for my needs and would highly recommend it for anyone."
"B0051VVOB2","3","My Fire is my 3rd Kindle. I loved the original, and the 3rd Gen (now called the Keyboard) is as close to perfection as the e-ink style could be. I have now had my Fire for several months, and it is true that I use it nearly daily. Since I read mostly news, magazines, and free current content rather than books, the Pulse app on the Fire is a one step alternative to using Calibre and a cable each day to side load content to the Kindle Keyboard. The sad part is, that nearly everything on the Fire relies on wifi availability at the time you are reading it, including your own 'cloud' library, AND including magazine purchased subscription content from Amazon. Even if I can see the magazine cover on my carousel, if I'm not near a working hotspot, I can't read complete articles in the magazines.  I have a hotspot on my cell phone, (Verizon) and whenever I am away from wifi, (ie at work, or sitting on a beach or in a nice park somewhere..) I attempt to use the Hotspot. I always get a very strong connection phone to kindle, but rarely does this result in a web page actually opening on the kindle. At the same location I am able to browse the web with the phone so it is evident the signal is there. So, since Amazon has chosen to withhold the option for internet access...despite the technological availability, I will regretfully be looking at the Apple alternative very soon. It truly saddens me that Amazon came SO CLOSE and yet chose to deprive its loyal customers by holding back on this most important feature."
"B0051VVOB2","5","For the price and everything I like to do with a tablet.......perfect!  Love the size for traveling, fits perfect in the purse."
"B0051VVOB2","5","The new Kindle Fire is a great device.  I love everything about it for the money.  I have owned every other Kindle, and this is by far the best."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Got the Fire for Xmas and couldn't be more pleased. The internet and apps are fast with very little to no hesitation when clicked. The screen is just the right size and the colors/graphics are really sharp. I think this is a great tablet and a much better price than the iPad. The only negative I would say is that there aren't that many apps available, but I'm sure that will change in time. I also like how there are 2 buttons on the device, \\""Cloud\\"" and \\""Device\\"". I like that you can access the Cloud right on the Fire. Huge time saver."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I do love my new Kendle Fire. I am having trouble keeping a movie playing, but I will get everything in order. I am loving playing games and all with it."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love the Kindle Fire.  I look at Netflix movies, post to Facebook, send & receive e-mail, browse, play games and  read a lot.  It is very user friendly.  Only thing to make it better would have been 3G.  Not sorry I got it in the least!  Portable and lightweight, perfect to pop in my purse."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My husband already had a Kindle but complained about having to use the clip-on light so I decided to get him the Kindle fire.  He really enjoys it plus all the wonderful features it has."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I have had my Fire for a year and I love it! This is a good device. Responsive screen and good graphics even without hd. I am amazed at some of the things it does and it is very quick when hooked up to wifi."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This is a great device for a great price.  Books, magazines, apps, email, and video- I use it everyday.  Amazon has always provided me with good service and I have been in third world countries!"
"B0051VVOB2","1","I returned mine after about two weeks. My biggest complaint is that Amazon limits what you can download from the Android App store. This basically forces you to use their version of the web browser to complete basic tasks. It is great for reading although it is a little heavy for its size. I would just spend the additional money to get a laptop as the ipad/tablet are useless as far as I'm concerned as I refer the keyboard to the touch screen."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I love my kindle fire!! Ive done my research on which tablet to buy from all different brands and I think for its price verses its features it a steal purchase. I agree its a little heavy after holding it for long lengths of time but the fire is on the lighter side compared to the ipad. All rounder great investment because of all the features available. Only problem I have is because I don't live in the States anymore I can no longer purchase new movie, games or magazines to read but that's not a downfall of the kindle just a matter of some features no longer available. Highly recommend."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I like the fire i really haven't had anyproblems with it except there is 2 books that i have been reading that i can't download still i hope they fix it soon so i can finish the books"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I loved this product and functionality,I got what I expected. But for some reason it doesn't connect wifi equipment from Netgear.... Which is really frustraiting. It connects with all wifi but netgear...  Thanks"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Best purchase I made from Amazon last year.  I've read five books since Christmas, and can't believe how easy it is.  And the apps are fantastic...  '"
"B0051VVOB2","1","The Kindle Fire is terrrible! Have been a very loyal Kindle customer since it first came out, bought one of the first ones. It started going and purchased the Fire. It is a terrible product. It is not intuitive at all. Tried to use the Fire for a while, but have not been able to get use out of it. The only thing it is good for is reading in bed, that is it. Was so disappointed that had to purchase the standard Kindle reader again. That works fine. Contacted customer service to see if they would work through a return of this terrible product and they are stead fast on buyer beware beyond 30 days. They will take a return and say you can get a tradein credit up to 80%, but it could be 20%. You just have to send it in and trust they would do the right thing. Based on experience with them, I would not trust them. We have purchased thousands of dollars of e-books through the years from Amazon for the Kindle and to be treated like this is terrible. I would highly recomend going to a place like Barnes & Noble where you can see and touch and use the product and go into the store if you have a problem. We have never had a return problem like this with Barnes & Noble. I cannot believe this is a policy that the CEO would endorse and would want to do to a loyal customer."
"B0051VVOB2","5","this is my first tablet i cant put it down, i had to come on here to let anyone with and  doubt know that they need to get this!!! ipad huh whats that??? thank u so much amazon!this was my bday  gift im so gratful to own a tablet thanks for making  an affordable one."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I am not a technical person so the Kindle Fire has everything that I need or want to play with. I have read books, watched movies, played games, checked the internet. It has worked fine for me. I though the movie quality was excellent. Really enjoying it so far."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Kindle Fire was purchased in February 2012, and to date we have had excellent results.  Wifi connections are easy, and download of apps are done perfectly.  Also, very easy for our Grandchildren to use."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I really like the Kindle Fire. It's convenient to be able to have your instant video library, books, music, and even apps for games and such. The touch screen is very sensitive to touch, which is good. However, the Kindle Fire lacks text-to-speech and the volume control is not easily accessible on the outside of the device. The touch screen is a bit touchy or sensitive at times that the wrong item is pressed at times. Other than those few things, it's great. It would be nice if amazon came out with a software update or something for it that covered all these bases/"
"B0051VVOB2","2","As a lifelong techie geek I had to have a kindle fire.   Pros: small and fits in purse, syncing is great and adding addl files. Surfing net is ok and the apps I am finding for free are worthwhile. The screen and video are of the finest quality.  Cons: I cannot adjust volume easily, I lose Internet  when I get more than a few yards from router. I got this primarily to watch movies on the net but if I get to far in my house it is useless.   I do have an iPad and hands down this is no match to the iPad. I can actually work at home with the pad and not the KF.  I would retun it but too lazy to do so.   Will be a nice tool or kids for fun but no serious work, or for older Indiviuals it would be easy to use."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I am very pleased with my Kindle Fire. It is exactly what I expected and does exactly what they say it does. The interface is quick and intuitive and the web browsing is very fast. Movies and TV stream perfectly. Apps work great. For long term reading, it could get tiresome on the eyes, however, I own an older Kindle that works perfect for this function.  Anyone comparing it to an ipad really needs to get their head checked. It's not an ipad and doesn't try to be. Read the technical specifications before you buy it so that you know what to expect. Make sure that it meets your needs. For a $200 device, the Fire is fantastic! And it's even better if you're an Amazon Prime member."
"B0051VVOB2","2","Anyone know if the kindle fire is going to be on sale for cyber monday?  I want this so bad but dont know if i want to pay the 200 for it."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my kindle.  Use it all the time, would not travel without it!  Color is really great, reading is very easy.  Jo"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my Kindle Fire.  There is so much that you can do on it.  You can read books, play games alone or with friends, you can go online, receive multiple emails accounts.  I downloaded a Bible and you can take notes.  It is like a mini computer because you can take it everywhere, even to church and it is not heavy and bulky.  Mine fits right in by pocketbook.  I bought this item on Amazon."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I absolutley LOVE my Kindle Fire! As stated above it works better than my computer (DO NOT EVER BUY A VISTA, WORST MISTAKE I EVER, EVER MADE)and my Android. Some downfalls would be, older Kindle games are not available on the Fire, the A/C Adaper cord NEEDS to be LONGER (*knock* *knock*, Amazon? Are you listening??) or maybe I need to work on my furnature arrangments becuase there's is no where in my house for me to sit comfortly (unless on the floor by the wall) and use my Kindle while plugged in. On the $79 Kindle, that I just bought my mother for her birthday she has this really, really long USB cord that you use to charge the device and transfer files, if I use the adapter (sold seperatly) to plug into the wall I'd have so much more freedom to camp where I want to use my Fire while charging. Only thing is you can only get this cord when you buy the original Kindle. All in all I LOVE MY FIRE and would recommend it to anyone and have done so. JUST GET ME A CORD LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY IT EVEN MORE, AMAZON!! :D"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Great inexpensive tablet. I have used it for about a week now. It's inexpensive and does everything I need it to- games, music, videos, not to mention screen looks good too."
"B0051VVOB2","5","great item for the price<br />great item will shop for more it meet what i was looking for kids are happy thank you see you soon"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I am a current iPad2 user and you know of course if we all could have iPads we would. Even $199 is still up the budget, but I am still looking into a kindle for school. People need to look at other compairisons, not Amazons*. Amazon is telling you all the doubts about the iPad but theres one problem that might affect a lot of people.... THERE IS NO CAMERA people, you cant use skype with video, is only good for reading, games and thats it, I would get and iPad for a tablet, because a kindle is meant for reading, but the screen is too small for what they are trying to do! And speaking of that the commersiael amazon just made with that random mom with 2 Kindle Fires and 1 kindle touch, but the kindle is better for reading, and the guy in the tv is right, the iPad is better for video, movies and viewing anything!"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I purchased the Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift for my wife.  I did not expect it to be an iPad killer and I was right!  It works just fine as a reader, I also have a Kindle Keyboard, but beyond that it is lacking... I had hoped that Silk was something that would improve browsing, instead it turned out to be the most kluberish excuse for a browser I have experienced. It is much like Windows 5 on their smart phone a couple of years ago, painfully slow! I mean 386 on a modem slow! I have Comcast high speed cable with a gigabit wireless router so the bottleneck is NOT in my network.<br /><br />I am not completely dissatisfied with the Fire, as I said, it is a very good reader and for the money it was a worthwhile purchase, I just wish the browser function was a fraction of what was advertised."
"B0051VVOB2","1","I was happy with Kindle fire until we set up a new network and now it will not pick up our wifi modem.everthing else in our home will connect so why not Kindle? Is there some secret? I have selected \\""add a new network\\"" but still no luck, help.<br />Thank you, Robert Gregory"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I may need new eyeglass prescription soon, but I am really enjoying the portability and accesability of the Fire. The price cannot be beat. Four and one-half stars. No more laptops for me."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my kindle fire - i use it to read books, browse the net and view powerpoint presentations... exactly why i bought it and its perfect. Although i cannot purchase music because i am an international buyer i am conformed that i can buy books with one click and i can preview them as well - absolutely great!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","For those considering the Kindle Fire, please do not mistake this with other tablets on the market.  This is first and foremost a content consumer.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that if you wish to consider the Fire, think about what you will use your tablet for.  If you want something to read books, comics, play apps, check your email, watch tv shows or movies, listen to music, then this device will do all of that well if not great.  I got mine the first day the 17th and have been happily using it daily since.  While it does not have features that the iPad has or the Android tablets do, it is also far cheaper than almost all of them.  Negatives would be that the speakers are both on one side, there is no means of downloading unless you are near a wifi hotspot, the memory is only 8gb (6gb that you can utilize), lack of a memory expansion slot and some limitations to the variety of apps.  Now with those negatives, the speaker one isn't a biggie as the sound is good and if you want surround you aren't really using the built ins on any of these devices, rather ear buds or headphones.  The lack of constant contact to the web while not always convenient, isn't all bad in part to the reason for the memory which I will get to, but also becuase I have a smartphone if I need instant connection and I would rather not add another data plan if I can.  Again costs are nicely minimized, but there is always a downside to that kind of thing.  The memory is a tricky thing, because I like being able to store loads of songs, movies and other content on my phone and Zune HD.  Well here, with the integration of the cloud and use of their Prime service, storage isn't as big a deal.  I can keep 6 or 7 720p movies on it that look spectacular, 50 - 100 books, a couple of albums, 20 - 30 apps that I like using, a magazine subscribtion and still have about 1 gb left to spare.  Would I like the extra space, yeah, but do I need it... not really.  Reality is that the extra storage space whilenice is really a crutch and having a limitation, at least to me, makes me only keep things that I really want to use with it.  Again this is not a swiss army knife to solve any problem that arrises, but rather a power screw driver that has an intended purposes with some utility, but again it is designed for a specific use and worrying or griping about what it can't do is missing the forest for the trees.  The last thing about the variety of apps, to me is more of a similar problem to the magazines.  Not all of them that I want are out there yet, but given time, they likely will be.  I guess patience is the key and am willing to not condemn it out of hand for that.  So overall, I am pleased with my Fire.  It incorporates a lot of various activities I like and the price was great to get me to take the plunge.  The size is nice in that is easily hand held and large enough that it does functions my phone can't do due to size limitations, while not being so big it is unwieldy.  I hope this helps others in their consideration.  This is worthwhile tech in my opinion and well worth the money if you are looking for something that can do the things this does and like Amazon as a portal for content consumption."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I can't wait until she asks for the next version so I can get the hand-me-down, this one, I have the previous model and it seems so technically far behind, but great for straight reading."
"B0051VVOB2","4","[[VIDEOID:mo2ZMG1HTI6AO8D]]Already this product has been extensively reviewed. But I'll briefly write my opinion here. Kindle Fire is an Amazon consumption device, not a real tablet. If you want to browse internet, check e-mail, watch Amazon Videos, shop Amazon products, listen to music, read books/magazines etc it's a good device. But if you want to use Google products efficiently(G docs, G maps, G music, G voice etc), have additional storage options through SD card, use microphone for voice/video chat (Skype, G+) etc you might wanna check out other devices. I bought [[ASIN:B004U78J1G ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet]] for the real tablet experience and it's a very impressive tablet.  I'm dropping one star because it gave me problem with WiFi connectivity. Check out the video I uploaded.(Shot on December 10th. Hopefully they fixed this issue). In the video Kindle Fire tries to log into WiFi, then crashes and reboots going into an infinite loop of crash and reboot. It's in factory reset state without any other apps installed other than those it was shipped with. The issue probably come from Pulse app and there could be some easy fix for it."
"B0051VVOB2","1","I have the Kindle 2nd Generation and am very happy with it. I can download books from just about anywhere. I was excited to get the Fire with it's WIFI ability.It wasn't clear in any of the info online that the ONLY way to connect is thru WIFI. No 3G or anything.  I do not have WIFI in my home and would have to drive somewhere to make the connection. I am returning the Fire."
"B0051VVOB2","3","The Kindle Fire was purchased as a gift for my wife, she is extremely pleased with the Kindle and the apps she is able to download and various functions she can use this item for. The only downside is it has developed lines on the screen that will not go away."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I am impressed at how the Kindle Fire [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]] is ready to pick up and operate at delivery, already tied to one's Amazon account.  The product was purchased for a family member who reads very heavily and although it was uncertain as to how it would be received, it turned out to be an awesome hit."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift over a year ago. He STILL loves it! He totes this device with him everywhere! We even play games together on it and even watching a movie is great! This Kindle has been and still is one of his favorite gifts  - a gift that has kept going."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I absolutely LOVE my Kindle Fire! Thieves stole my Kindle...& the joke is on them! I had it DEREGISTERED & now it is totally useless to the them! LOL! It is reported to Amazon as stolen, so it can't be re-registered by anyone but me (if recovered)! This is a wonderful feature of the Kindle Fire. I reaslly miss my Kindle Fire & am ordering a new one right now."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I bought this for my grandson who likes to read.  He has gotten several free books , but I think you don't save much when you BUY a book because it's only 2 dollars cheaper than a real book.  That was the whole idea of buying the Kindle, was to save money.<br /> Linda S."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my Kindle Fire, the only drawback is it is very hard to read when outside in bright sunlight.  I have had many hours of great reading on it though with no problems whatsoever."
"B0051VVOB2","1","BOUGHT THIS JUNE 2012, IT ONLY LASTED TILL FEBRUARY 2015. I Bought a 2 year warranty that should of lasted till June 2015. But they tell me the warranty started the same day the Kindle 1year warranty started. So actually I paid all that money for a two year warranty and it was only for one year. That was a SCAM. Kindle Fires should last longer than 2 years and 8 months. Beware when purchasing a Kindle Fire. The thing is too, my husband only used it like maybe a couple of hours a day. Sure Amazon wanted us to send it in to be repaired for a costly fee. We are big users of Amazon. I am so disappointed with them, as a loyal customer. I doubt this will even get posted. But think first before you purchase something that they won't back up for you. His Kindle still looks brand new too. Sad customer service!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Purchased it for my wife for Xmas after extensive research, so far have been very pleased. Does exactly what it's designed for. For the Ipad lovers, you can have your camera and your 3g connection and the device so big you look ridiculous taking pictures or videos. We can hold this in one hand, touch screen is vivid and responsive. Complaints about the power button are silly, just turn it over. Fairly intuitive, we navigated through most everything without any operator's guide. The power of Amazon gives great potential going forward for content and growth. I understand a software update is imminent to address some concerns about the home page, I don't see a problem. My 8 year old played games and watched a movie we downloaded, only took several minutes on my home wireless network, faster than my download on itunes. Battery life seems fine, and the concern re: limited apps is unwarranted, most all the most popular apps are available and who needs to (or actually does)scroll and search through 1/2 million apps avail for the Ipad. All for a package price less than half the competitors.  Well done Amazon."
"B0051VVOB2","1","This Kindle \\""Fire\\"" device has been nothing but a disappointment. First, it's slow, painfully slow, agonizingly slow -at every task. Second, the touch-screen functionality is as terribly buggy and not only for web pages and games, you have to be VERY careful about turning pages in a book as well!. Third, if the battery gets below 90% you can kiss all Internet functionality goodbye. Finally, on day 45 (15 days after Amazon would have to take it back) it developed lines at one end of the screen, one red one and a blue one -they are visible through every application.<br /><br />They should have hired at least one person to test these devices before selling them to their customers.<br />I despise Amazon for what they have done to the Kindle identity with this device, it's an embarrassment.<br /><br />I was NOT expecting an iPad for $200 but I was expecting this device to AT LEAST be capable of the meager functions that Amazon claims for it!<br />The entire product description page (in my very recent experience) is a long list of lies. But don't take my word for it, THROW AWAY $200 on your own,<br />then get feel humiliated, and write your own review.<br /><br />This:<br /> [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]<br />is just so much deceit.<br /><br />Amazon should pull this trash from the market and refund our hard earned cash to all of us saps who bought one. Imagine the lifelong spending habits this will change.<br />Look at me, for instance, I could be returning here to buy more stuff. Instead I'm here trying to warn folks that Amazon is cheating us.<br /><br />This all harkens back to what my Grandmother told me many years ago, \\""I don't buy costume jewelry, I save my money just a little bit longer and buy the real thing and I've never been disappointed.\\"""
"B0051VVOB2","2","Enough has been said about what it has done right, so I will only talk about three major flaws, and they are big ones!<br /><br />1. No Memory Slot:  You only get 1.17 GB for applications which gets eaten up real quick when you start downloading games, Facebook, Twitter, Weather and so on.  If you dip below the 250 MB your Fire's speed will be cut in half, and you will get a warning that you need to delete something to speed the Fire up, so you really need to subtract 250 MB as your Fire slows down and apps become unbearably slow!  THIS IS A HUGE FLAW in the Fire.  I am sure the Fire 2 will come out with a micro-sd slot, though.<br /><br />2. The App Store:  This is NOT the Android Play store, this is the Amazon Android store.  Apps usually are priced at twice the amount you can get them on your Android phone, this is simply not called for.  Also any App they may interfere with Amazon's business model will be blocked.  Amazon wants you shopping ONLY at Amazon!<br /><br />3. No Web Browser: The Fire does not allow you to use any browser but a modified version of theirs or a Maxthon Mobile Web Browser.  No Firefox, and No Google!  The Maxthon does run with the Google search bar, but Amazon's web browser always takes you to their shopping page.<br /><br />So there you have it, 3 MAJOR FLAWS, that the Kindle Fire should not have been released with!  There are some minor flaws like no camera, and no skype, and no IM'ing, but I use my Android for that, but I would use the Kindle Fire for those minor flaws as well, just out of convenience.<br /><br />So, unless the Kindle Fire 2 addresses the 3 Major Flaws, I will be going with some other type of E-Reader/Tablet, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 or 10.1"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I'm not a rambler so I'll just list what I don't like in bullet form:   - No fixed Back or Home Buttons... You'd be surprised how annoying it is to do extra taps just to get to these basic functions   - Takes like 4 taps spread out all over to get to volume controls   - Device is much heavier than I expected   - OMG... Like none of the games I like are in the App store... Seriously, NONE!   - Felt like the wifi was too volatile.  I have good wifi signal on other devices in my home but it dropped too often on the Kindle.  Overall just found myself getting frustrated with it.  Liked:   - Battery life seemed really good (for the two days I had it)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I'm an Apple guy.  I wouldn't trade my iPhone for anything Android, nor would I trade my MacBook for anything PC.  So when Amazon debuted the Kindle Fire, I was skeptical.  Would it really deliver?  I waited until well after the Fire began shipping before making the decision to part with $200 (maybe a pittance to some, but not to me!).  I read reviews for days, and I kept going back and forth on \\""should I hold out for an iPad?\\""  In the end, I decided that the Fire was the tool for me and that I'd keep the extra $300 to buy diapers and baby food with.    In all the reviews I've read, I think that the common denominator on the poor reviews is that everyone expected an iPad-like product for a cell phone like price.  I know full well that the iPad has more functionality, more apps, more screen size, etc.  However, like many of the reviews I've read, if you don't need all that, then the Kindle Fire will blow you away.  It certainly did me.    As an e-reader, it's already replaced my Kindle keyboard, due to the simple fact that I can read late at night or early in the morning without turning on a light and waking up my wife.  And no crazy priced lighted case to have to worry about, either.  Books display well, and the features imbedded in the Kindle work great.  I certainly like typing notes much better than with the Kindle keyboard. No problems with weight or anything.  I hold it just like my old Kindle.  I really like the ability to see the books in the Carousel and the home screen.  Much easier to find than on the Kindle 3.  Yeah, having the ability to organize the books would be nice, but it's not that big a deal.  You can always click on the \\""book\\"" tab and go to the author view if you don't like looking at all your books as once.    Second, playing games (which my kids LOVE) is a blast on the larger screen, a huge step up from my phone.  No, it's not the iPad screen, but for $200, it works really well.  And who cares about all the apps not displaying in every screenorientation?  Have we really become so lazy that we can't flip it around?  And a free app a day is pretty cool, too.   Third, my experience with Silk and email has been good.  I'm not going to sit and compose major emails, or browse through a ton of web pages on this thing.  That's why I have a laptop.  But if I want to check something, or respond to a quick email, the Fire works great.    Fourth, the touch screen works fine for me.  Yeah, every once in a while it doesn't respond as quick and I have to tap again, but you know what?  My iPhone is the same way.  And yeah, every so often I fly past something in the carousel.  You know what I do?  I SLOW DOWN HOW I SCROLL.  Not that difficult, really.  As to the touchscreen keyboard, I've had no problems with it.  Maybe it's because I'm used to typing on my iPhone, but I wonder what people were expecting.  Touch screens on every device I've ever used are kind of hooky, including the iPhone.  And you know what?  Operator error enters in more than device error.  Fifth, the Cloud storage is great.  I've loaded quite a bit of music up, and the Fire streams it seamlessly.  Volume is good for a small device.  Haven't tried headphones yet, but will do that soon, I'm sure.  Video from Prime is seamless, too.  The combination of Cloud storage, free shipping, and free content will probably entice me to become a Prime member when the trial runs out.  Tough to beat for under $7 a month.   In the end, the Fire does everything I hoped it would do and it does it well.  I was struck when reading many of the reviews by much of the criticism that we are truly a spoiled people nowadays.  The Fire is not going to change my life, or complete me.  It's a fun gadget that allows me to do fun things in an easy and convenient way.  It's for ENTERTAINMENT, and  it does it extremely well.    The only thing I would seriously like to see change is the one-click option.  C'mon Amazon!  We WANT to put our passwords in to purchase!  It's not that big an inconvenience!  It's certainly easier than your having to deal with 100 cancellations and refunds when my kids purchase that Barbie Playhouse they've been wanting, but dad doesn't think they need!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my Kindle!!! I have a hard time reading books and this makes it so easy, I am reading almost a book a day!! Thsnk you Amazon."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This is a fantastic e-reader. The wireless connection is fast, and it is very nice to take on a trip. My only \\""wish\\"" was that a booklet had come to explain how to use it. I still haven't figured out how to change the font or make it easier to see in the sunlight. But, still learning. All in all, a fantastic reader."
"B0051VVOB2","2","The Fire falls somewhere between an i-Phone and i-Pad and functions well indoors or in deep shade. Forget using it in bright light or full sun because with it's glossy finish, all you see if your own reflection.  Polarized sunglasses turn the screen completely black.  If your primary goal is to use this device as a reader, select one of the lesser models which have a different screen.<br /><br />And the battery life is not what's advertised either.  I'm disappointed.  I wanted to use this as a reader and when I took it on a Caribbean vacation, I ended up reading actual books, which I could see."
"B0051VVOB2","5","With 18,000+ reviews of the Fire online already, it seems almost superfluous to add another.  But here's one for any of you who have a friend or relative who is a bit computer-phobic: The Fire could be the answer!<br /><br />We have tried for YEARS to get my 89-year-old mother-in-law to master some form of computing.  We've tried with a Mac, and with a laptop.  No matter what we tried, she was intimidated, and it went nowhere.<br /><br />Then I got a Fire.  I already had an earlier Kindle, and I have to say, from my own perspective, I liked that but I LOVE the Fire.  I use it every day.  But as we experimented with the tap-click approach of a stylus, we thought... Hmmm... Maybe THIS would be the solution.<br /><br />So we got another one.  We presented it to MIL.  And within a few hours she was giggling like a schoolgirl as she figured out how to master one technique after another.  She asked if she could use it to look up stock quotes -- yep, we can do that.  Now she knows exactly how to find her quotes at the end of the day.  She can finally read e-mail messages, AND send them, AND look at pictures as attachments.  We got her a Dominoes app, and she's figured out how to work that.<br /><br />It's not a replacement for a computer, but for her, it does everything she needs.  It's more \\""intuitive\\"" than a tablet (tried one, didn't like it).  It responds well despite occasional tremors in her hands.  She likes the fact that if she wants to get out of something, she doesn't have to do anything complicated - just hit the \\""home\\"" button.<br /><br />We really had been on the point of giving up ever dragging MIL into the \\""computer\\"" age.  So, thanks, Amazon, for giving a lovely, active 89-year-old lady a chance to experience a new dimension in the electronic age!<br /><br />(Did I mention I love it too???)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Bought this for grandaughter she has loved it. Play on it all the time. I plan on getting my other gradaughter one for her birthday."
"B0051VVOB2","3","Kindle is not what you think the apps don't always work right and downloading it say cants display this  need to go throw Amazon to get download .  What did i get for a free one month from Amazon anyway ???  not bad display but you are confined to use amazon most of the time  well that's what you get for a cheap price !!!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","after buying my first e-book, after the download i started to read it, well so far 2 pages were missing. and that is unacceptable, Dean Koontz 77 shadow street"
"B0051VVOB2","5","i already have a iPad , and I only use for basic use like games , Internet ,some personel business, So I picked up the kindal fire for my wife for Christmas ,and I was very impressed,for not only half the price quite the bargin . It could almost do every thing the iPad could do.only thing screen is smaller and my wife is very happy with it"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I bought this item for my wife as a Christmas gift, and she absolutely loves it. She also has a Kindle Wi-Fi that she uses for reading many of her books, but having the new Kindle Fire with its crisp color display, and being able to access games, web sites, and magazine content is a great addition to her media consumption experience.  I was concerned about reviews that I had seen where people complained about the power button being on the bottom of the tablet, and causing them to accidentally turn their unit off. My wife discovered that the Kindle Fire orients the viewing content to what ever position you happen to be holding the unit in. So, from her perspective, the power button is ALWAYS on the tp of the unit. Problem solved.  One negative comment that I do agree with when reading other reviews is that the unit should have had a manual volume control. This is a significant design flaw, and having to locate and access volume controls via the screen is a huge pain and inconvenience.  Over all, I give this product a big thumbs up. Great value for the money. Available content is reasonable and vast, and it is easy to use. if you are looking for a great way to enjoy and use media content, but don't want to spend the money on an expensive tablet PC or i-pad, this is definitely a great alternative and a solid electronic device."
"B0051VVOB2","3","On a whim I picked up a Kindle Fire today from SAMS and it was pretty good up to the point of not having any native Safari Books Online application or solid browser support for the site.  I need a more flexible e-reader, looks like I'll be returning the unit at this point.  It's understandable that Amazon isn't keen about supporting more that a few competitive content providers/applications - however, not doing so is going to be a show stopper for many.  Nice but not good enough."
"B0051VVOB2","5","i received my Kindle Fire on March 7th, I love everything about it.  I also own a the Kindle 3g with the keyboard,  and was amazed how all of my books transferred over to my Kindle Fire.  i had no problems getting started and learning the FIRE.  i was able to go right to my emails, pandora, and other apps with no problems at all.  I sat my Kindle Fire down, and my husband picked it up to play with it. He was amazed to see everything that the Fire has to offer. I guess I will be ordering another Kindle Fire for him shortly.  I will never compare the Kindle Fire to a tablet or a notebook,  I use my Kindle Fire to READ and listen to pandora. My husband uses it to go online and search the web................WE LOVE IT!!!!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","a very responsive and excellent item, I love the apps, and it also provide with free apps everyday, which usually costs between 1$ to 5$."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Luv it Luv it Luv it. I mostly read on my Kindle Fire but could do alot of other things.<br />If you can, you must get one. Neater than hoot owl babies"
"B0051VVOB2","5","My husband bought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas.  I am an avid book reader and wasn't at all sure that I could make the switch to reading from a tablet.  Well, I love it!  It is easy to download the books and the automatic features such as a built in bookmark etc. are great.  Also, because it is so beautifully back lit, I can read in bed without disturbing my husband by turning on a lamp.  It is the perfect size and I find myself carrying it downstairs in the morning to check my e-mail while making tea.  It is extremely responsive.  No waiting time for it to \\""boot up.\\""  It comes on instantly.  It is truly a mini computer in every way.  I can do almost everything with it that I do with my HP TouchSmart.  I can't wait to take a trip with it.  No lugging six heavy books with me to last the week. And guide books for vacation spots are right there when you want to look something up. I want to get a cover for it because I believe some of them have a strap that makes it easy to hold the Kindle Fire while reading. This is a wonderful item."
"B0051VVOB2","1","I'm began writing this review on the kindle and finished on my laptop.  This was a gift and I am grateful,  but this kindle has a long, long way to go.  Its extremely frustrating to type on, it lags so bad, and half the time videos wont play, and it will just kick you off pages you were on.  Like I said it was a gift and I will continue to use it, but even my wife says after using this she wants an ipad instead."
"B0051VVOB2","1","Too small, can't read anything and books do not download to the end. Get an iBook. There are not 20 words I can say about how bad this product is without being nasty. If you want to just read, get a Kindle. If you want to do it all, get the iBook."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I unexpectedly received a Kindle Fire for Christmas! After several days of playing with it, there are four serious reservations I have:  1) It's slow, slow, slow. You never know if you pushed/did/whatever the right thing, because the response time is such an abomination.  2) market.android.com stuff, which is for Android devices, don't work on the Kindle Fire. Real BUMMER. I expected Android stuff to work.  3) Even a lot of Amazon's downloads get a \\""red X\\"" next to \\""Tom's Kindle\\"", indicating that a lot of stuff they're even offering doesn't work on my Kindle.  4) Their newsreader, Pulse, displays the first para or two of an article and then has a button to \\""go to original article\\"" for continued reading. Doesn't work, Period. You would think even their newsreader would work, wouldn't you? Of course, the NBC news widget at market.android.com won't download/install on this stupid Fire either, since it's not from Amazon.  I'm really disappointed. Lack of software. Lack of responsiveness. Great hardware, I suppose, but what can you do with it. They're going to have to go a long way to make this thing usable."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This one of the best buy's that I have made. After checking out the other books<br />on the market this one beats them all. Guess I mite upgrade some day but not very soon. Amazon had the best prices and there was no state sales taxes to be paid."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Amazon hits a home run. The Kindle Fire has got to be one of the best values out there  . I was skeptical when my wife said she wanted the Fire for Christmas {she opened it immediately} that Amazon could come through for that amount of money, but they sure did. My wife has not put it down since it arrived, she let's me use it occasionally and even I can get around on it. I'm not sure why some of the tech experts keep trying to compare it to the ipad, it is not in that catagory and wasn't meant to be. The few complaints that I have read about seem to be fairly minor, we haven't felt that those are real problems: the volume control, the on/off switch. If I can figure out these minor things then anybody should be able to. This is one of those devices that does exactly what it was designed to do at a very reasonable price. Good Job Amazon."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I bought this to use as an internet browser - so I don't have to boot up my laptop or squint at my iphone.  And it works great for that.  It's instant internet gratification for those random questions that pop up while watching TV or chatting with someone or whenever."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I've used this a lot more than I thought I would.  It's quick, easy-to-read, light-weight, compact, inexpensive... And I love Android and Amazon... so yeah, it's basically the complete package.  5/5 for me."
"B0051VVOB2","5","But with that being said this is perfect, fully integrated with Amazon services. I actually had a HP Touchpad loved WebOS wish it had more support but it was just to large for one handed use for reading, etc. This is much more portable and light weight. Anyway love this device."
"B0051VVOB2","5","The Kindle Fire was for a friend and she loves it. It has so many functions she uses it more than her laptop. I would recommend it to anyone who wants more for less. It was easy to setup and operate."
"B0051VVOB2","1","If you depend on captions like I do, do NOT get the Kindle Fire.  There are no captions available at all.  Stick with a regular kindle for reading and use the IPAD for captions on their videos."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My kindle is my new best friend...there is so much to do with it! I read my books, but I love my web browser and apps. It rotates and the touchscreen works very well. It is beautiful and versatile; I can watch my favorite shows and listen to all my music with Amazon Cloud Services. Still got a lot to learn with it though; I downloaded Documents To Go app and can see and manipulate all my documents from Microsoft Word; even edit them! I love this piece of technology! Great price too!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! I no longer have to go to the book store I can just press a button & I have the books I want"
"B0051VVOB2","5","This kindle fire is great for all ages. This makes you want to read more. I think ALL parents should buy one as a gift for anyone.. this is a great product. THANK YOU AMAZON! You Rock.. :)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I purchased this in 2011.  My mother purchased the Nook Color about the same time.  It's 2014 (almost 2015) andI I still use my Kindle Fire 1st gen practically every day.  Everyday.  Books, Movies, Games, Websurfing, Textbooks for School, Notes in class/church. I have never  had an issue that a restart didn't solve.  I purchased a paperwhite for my mother within the first year of her Nook.  She had countless problems and compliants with little to no help from her book's customer service. Her new Kindle stopped accepting a charge within the first year.  Amazon apologized, shipped her a new one immediatley and assisted in transfering her information and content.  She was so astonished by the excellent service and Amazon standing behind their product she asked for the Fire for her birthday.  I use my Fire everyday.  My mother uses her's everyday throughout the day.  Retired, she reads constantly and listens to audibooks on her Fire as well.  Very happy, years later and still happy.  We tell everyone that Kindle is the ereader/tablet to buy.  It's not just excellence in product, it's the continued excellence in service."
"B0051VVOB2","4","When I purchase any electronic device I always check the reviews first.  I wanted a 7\\"" model so it would easily fit in my purse while traveling around.  I also wanted access to email for all my accounts, the ability to watch Netflix movies, to play a few games, maybe read a colorful magazine or book every so often (but I have a Kindle for most of my books), and occasionally be able to access certain favorites web sites.  And, being in my 60's and not a 'techie' type, I wanted something with a simple learning curve right out of the box.  After reading reviews for three models, I finally settled on Kindle Fire, and I'm happy I did, even though there are a few irritating quirks.  But the positives outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Many reviewers have expressed pros and cons in prior reviews, so I won't go through this in detail.  I will, however, tell you that, once I fully charged the unit, operating it was easy.  I had no trouble setting up all email accounts for me and my spouse.  It is equally easy to find, download and play games.  I love how easy it is to navigate through the screens.  Watching Netflix movies is easy and clear, but I wish the volume would go a bit louder.  It's hard to hear through the unit's speaker when I'm outdoors.  There is also a lot of glare off the glass.  Indoors in a quiet house, no problem.  The only other negative is that I sometimes have to tap the screen multiple times...or with greater force, to get the Fire to recognize my request.  That's a bit annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought it.  It serves my purpose so far, though I'd eventually like to get a 10\\"" tablet, too.  But for now, this works for me."
"B0051VVOB2","3","Dispapointed as I live in Jamaica....and you are not able to use some of the applications or watch movies as it is restricted to US residents only.....i think amazon needs to make customers aware that this products is restricted...so I only have an internet and book reading device....which is not what I purchased it for!!!"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I received my Kindle Fire in January 2012 & at first it worked really well. Presently I have a problem with it starting. it is not a daily problem but every few days when i turn on my Kindle it reboots itself for some reason. Also, I do not live in the US. I have shopped in Amazon for many years & never had a problem using my card but Kindle will not accept any card not issued in the US for one click shopping on their device. I do not understand why Amazon can accept it but Kindle which is an Amazon product, WILL not. I can not download FREE apps without a US credit card. This makes no sense to me. If it's free & I have obviously bought the product why do I need a card to download a free app? I can't  even download FREE magazines because my Kindle is not supported outside the US. Amazon needs to let buyers be aware that if you do not have a US card or you're not located in the US then what you can purchase for FREE (?!?!?!?!?! - go figure) is limited.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother to recommend this product to anyone. Better off getting an ipad"
"B0051VVOB2","5","All the complaints are from those who expected the Fire to be a replacement for the IPad, which it was never intended to be nor was it marketed by Amazon to be.  It is perfect for those who like an e-reader and it also gives me access to apps and the internet."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Everything I hoped it would be and much more ! It has all the features I want in a tablet but is an incredibly convenient e reader also. Brilliant product!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","This Kindle fire is awesome, it's everything I need  for a small note pad. It's easy to use and operate. I've read a couple of books already and made a few downloads and everything has worked great."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I cannot tell you how much I love my Kindle Fire. Words cannot describe. It is better than chocolate cake! Let me say, however, that I am also someone who has been forced kicking and screaming into the world of eReaders, handheld devices, etc. I still have a \\""stupid\\"" phone that only calls, texts (another trauma), and takes still pics! I could not make myself pay for an iPad and I just don't trust all those weird names out there on the digital market so as soon as I saw the Kindle Fire advertised, I signed up for one. It arrived before Thanksgiving and I sat up until 2 AM cradling it in my arms. I adore it. It is wonderful! The app store, while not iTunes worthy YET meets all my needs and has all my daughter's favorite games, the streaming movies are great, and I am a READER so I love all the Kindle edition books...especially the free ones! I can glut myself on text whether night or day now that I have this wonderful LCD screen. I know some people say it is heavy, but they are crazy! It is no heavier than a paperback book and the screen size is perfect for me too. Thank you Amazon! I love you that care enough about your customers to 1) develop this technology and 2) make it affordable. I hope you sells kazillions of these!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","When I bought the KINDLE to read my favorite books, I thought<br />it was the BEST thing EVER!  Then all of a sudden, here comes<br />the KINDLE FIRE/wi-fi!!!  Now I think this is the BEST thing ever.<br />I am REALLY enjoying the use.  (Reading, games, internet etc.)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I do not own an iPhone or an iPad--cost vs. benefit is not justifiable for me, at least for now.  I was actually looking for a gadget to read books, and had looked at previous Kindle models but had not been completely convinced.  When Amazon sent out a pre-order announcement, and the Fire was priced at $199, I went for it.  We love it!!!!  I've read multiple reviews from users and professionals (CNet, Washington Post, to name a couple), and I agree:  it serves the purpose I bought it for (reading books) and it gives me so much more.  I had not intended this for him, but my husband has taken half ownership of it ... :-)  He's now using it to read books, search the web or read news, play games.  He is delighted with it.  The screen size and sharpness is great--you can really see things well, which is a plus for older people like us.  The amount of apps is OK, and I know it does not yet compare to those available for Apple products, but it is enough for us.  We are very happy with this purchase."
"B0051VVOB2","1","Many people are having problems with the charging ports on the Kindle Fire.  Once the Kindle is out of warranty the customer is out of luck even though this is a defect in the device and not caused by user recklessness.  Amazon should do the right thing and offer customers an inexpensive fix or a real discount (not $30) on a new one.  I would caution anyone against buying a Kindle."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I purchased the Kindle Fire this morning for my mother as an Xmas gift. I was looking for a device that would be easy to use with intuitive navigation and a clean layout. For the most part, the Kindle Fire fits the bill on these two requirements. However, the pre-loaded apps and bookmarks(IMDb, Amazon Store, ESPN, Craigslist, Pulse) that cannot be deleted, the mandatory credit card registration and the overall inability to truly customize anything is a real turn off. It brings me right back to the mid-1990s when every computer came with AOL and other bloatware that sucked up storage space and RAM and generally got in the way of how I wanted to use MY computer. While your Kindle Fire might have 8GB of total space, in actuality you have just under 6.5GB. I'm not interested in cloud storage and it's not something that would be convenient for my mother - for whom this gift was intended - as she does not have regular access to wifi.  PROs:  - I really like the size of the device, which is why I initially didn't go with the iPad. (Going to return this and probably going to go with the 7\\"" Galaxy Tab...after some more research..or maybe the iTouch.)  - Good physical design, especially the rubberized back.  - Decent interface design and navigation  CONs:  - I absolutely HATE the preloaded software...in principle and in terms of impact on device function. It sucks up storage space and clutters my app shelf with crap I would never, ever be interested in. IMDb, please!! Rotten Tomatoes is so much better!  - There is a noticeable delay in typing that can be frustrating when trying to bang out a search query or other text.  - The touchscreen itself seems a bit finicky - you might have to push several times and at different angles and degrees of pressure to get, say, the menu to appear or to return to the home screen  - Mandatory credit card registration. This is just ridiculous - it was Amazon's database that was hacked this past summer, compromising hundreds of thousands of users' credit card information (so says my bank rep). (I was on a business trip when I learned that my card had been suspended with a new one being mailed for security purposes). Why should I be required to make myself vulnerable to further data theft? If I want to purchase something through the Amazon store, I will happily enter my payment information each time. This - coupled with the bloatware - signals an overall lack of customer-centricity in Amazon's marketing and business practices...well, that may be a bit harsh. They do have a great return policy. But the bloatware and the mandatory cc registration really chap my hide."
"B0051VVOB2","5","kindle is a great way to save space. being an avid reader was slowly eating up all of the available storage space in my house. i am now free to read as much as i want and still get around the house. the piles of books will not grow any bigger.old lady thanks you"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I have an ipod touch 4th and I thought it was the greatest thing until i got the kindle fire......I love it, too!! And love the battery charge life.....I can read all day long. Love everything on it....the only thing it can use is an expandable memory......for other things beside books. I have over 400 books on my kindle and have room for more, but I would really liked to have more pictures and movies on it."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This is one of the best items Amazon as ever come up with. It works perfectly and the internet service is spectacular and my daughter absolutely loves it."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I will start off saying that I have never owned a smart phone, or an iPad or other tablet. I haven't used or bought an e-reader of any kind, so this is my first experience with any of this stuff. I bought the Kindle Fire primarily as an e-reader, with extra capability of watching streaming movies/TV shows and music--I don't intend to use it to surf the web. And so--it does what I want it to do. So far I have not actually purchased any Kindle books, but I have borrowed from the Amazon Prime Lending Library and also from my library via Overdrive. Checking books out and getting them to the device is very easy. The standard settings for font, size, etc. have worked very well for me thus far, and turning pages is very easy with the touch screen. I like how the orientation of the books on the device changes too, so you can hold it either horizontally or vertically.<br /><br />For watching movies, while the screen is (of course!) smaller than a computer or TV, the color and definition is excellent and I have had no problems with the connection issues or the media stalling as some have reported--perhaps more an issue with the wireless connection than any fault of Amazon itself? Not sure. One thing I do like is that if I stop the show on my Kindle Fire midway through, then resume watching on my TV, it 'knows' where I left off and resumes there. The sound seems fine to me--I primarily use with headphones, though.<br /><br />I've downloaded several free apps for weather, calorie counting, a few simple games, MapQuest, etc. and those work quite well. The color is vibrant and I haven't had any issues with clumsiness of the touch screen when using those.<br /><br />I have done a little connecting to the web, mostly to see how it worked, and if there is a fault, this would be it--the webpages are not that easy to see, with much scrolling needed, and pressing radio buttons and such are awkward with my larger fingers. It's hard for me to type on the keyboard--I think a stylus would make it much easier, but it's not anything I didn't expect given my larger hands, and also similar problem to when I have tried using the smaller keyboard on a laptop computer or on the QWERTY keyboard of my internet-connected HD TV. Not sure that there's any way to correct that problem. Since I don't plan to use the Kindle Fire for much web browsing this really isn't an issue for me--it's nice to have the capability to check e-mail and such when really needed and away from my regular computer, but not something I will use it for regularly.<br /><br />So far I love it and have really no complaints, but then I didn't expect it to work just like a full-service computer, either.not anything I didn't expect given my larger hands, and also similar problem to when I have tried using the smaller keyboard on a laptop computer or on the QWERTY keyboard of my internet-connected HD TV.

"B0051VVOB2","5","I've had my kindle fire since February and 5 months later I can say it was worth it. Love the games available. Amazon instant video is great, I have wifi at home so I can stream my netflix. I take it to school with me for downtime between classes. Small and not heavy and the sound is good. Great price for a great product."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This has to be the best thing I have ever owned.the features are great and though it is a bit touchy the browse is smooth and fast. All the best part of Ipad but so much cheaper. I actually have several friends and family wanting one for themselves. Highly recommended."
"B0051VVOB2","3","Several reviewers expressed concern that anyone can purchase products on the kindle with the one click function..this is only if the one click function is turned on..to turn it off, one needs to click on \\""your account\\"" on the right hand corner of the amazon site..under settings, click on \\""1 click settings\\"", then make sure one click ordering is turned off on the right hand side..this can be done from the kindle fire, but it's much easier from a PC..once turned off, you will need your amazon password to make any purchases..  For password protection, just click on the little wheel in the top right hand corner of your device..then click \\""more\\"" and \\""security\\"", then lock the screen and create a password..now everytime you turn your kindle on, you'll be asked for your password..  Another major issue has been with the button at the bottom of the device..well, it does not have to be at the bottom..the device works just fine with the button at the top, or on either side, left or right (and of course at the bottom)..  So I really like this device, but like many other reviewers, have found several flaws, some big, some small..the biggest one is that the carousel cannot be customized and that all content and apps end up here and cannot be removed..I hope amazon quickly fixes this problem..another one that many have not mentioned is that the screen is very susceptible to fingerprints..and physical volume controls would have been great..not letting people upload personal content to the cloud is also lame..after all, this is not a free device, in which case amazon may have had some reason to restrict content..I hope this policy is changed soon..  For $200 it's a great device that will only get better as some of the glitches are fixed. It has potential to be a 4 star or even a 5 star product, but it needs to improve."
"B0051VVOB2","5","We got it for our kids for Christmas and think they will love it. We hope they will like it as much as my computer they hog up.<br /><br />Todd"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I am an over the top pleased owner of the old plain Kindle with Keyboard, and I use it exclusively for reading - I just can't tell you how thrilled I am with it, in ALL respects, without belaboring the point, except to say that I am just so pleased with it to be able to select from an awesome selection of very reasonably priced books, to have them automatically downloaded almost instantly, to be able to read them easily in any lighting situation, and when I close a book down, or when its  closed down automatically after a predesignated period of non use, I can open it up very quickly and take off just where I was!  WOW!!!!!  And overall, I am absolutely an Amazon fan, making almost all of my product purchases (except gasoline, groceries, and prescription drugs) from Amazon.  I purchased the Kindlefire, for, among other things, to use as a movie viewer - I am a subscriber to Amazon's Excellent Prime Service, as well as to Netflix. I have four computers I own that when connected to heavily encrypted wi-fi provide all the convenient movies I would like to see.  And for a 40 inch LCD and a 109 inch front projected screen, Amazon's Hi-Def Streaming can't be beat.  So you see how happy I am with Amazon, and my reaction to the Kindlefire is absolute delight, in being able to download the aforementioned movies to it, to watch while sitting in airports, waiting rooms, etc.    I also have the competing Barnes and Noble Color Nook running an advanced Android OS - In terms of loading times, convenience and user friendliness, the Kindlefire wins in all and many other respects!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I really love the apps and all that the Fire offers, except...there isn't an audio choice for the books.  It would be awesome to be able to have the books read to me while I'm driving, or while cooking.  I'm hoping there will be an upgrade at some point to include this feature.  Also, it would be helpful to have a scrolling funciton, like on my HTC Desire.  There have been quite a few times where scrolling a web page or a comment is difficult to pinpoint where you want to with your finger tip.  A scrolling sensor would be great or even on screen arrows that pop up like the keyboard.  Aside from those 2 issues that I have, I love the Fire.  I love that I can take my apps and web and books with me where ever I need to.  When I want to check facebook, but don't want to get sucked into the computer, I grab my Fire and sit down with it for a couple minutes and then move on to one of my Kindle books."
"B0051VVOB2","5","This is my first ereader and I love it. I think it is very heavy tho after I went to Best Buy and held others. I have already read a few books on this and learned how to play angry birds. I don't think I will watch movies on it unless it had a jack to hook up to my tv."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my Kindle Fire.  I read, go online, play games etc.  I think it is a wonderful item and I imagine I will use it for a long time.  I am totally satisfied with the Fire."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I absolutely love the Kindle Fire. I am a reader and always said \\""I would NEVER get an eBook\\"" b/c I like to hold my books and turn the pages, etc. But reading on this is amazing, similar to a book. It's not just an eBook, it is a tablet and does everything the iPad does! The picture on this is stunnng! If you're looking for a great gift for someone-this is it!"
"B0051VVOB2","1","This product is awful, If I could I would give it zero stars!<br />Poor built quality, slow and unresponsive.  In other words you get what you pay for."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I have owned a Nook Color since Christmas last year and got the Kindle Fire for Christmas this year.  I like the Kindle Fire much better than the Nook Color.  This is a perfect device for someone that really wants a reader for books and magazines and the capability to watch TV shows and movies.  This is not really a replacement for a computer or if you are really looking for a tablet.  I downloaded the upgrade for the Nook Color so I could see the video capability, but really NetFlix and Hulu Plus were the only things available.  If you've been on NetFlix, you know the selection of movies for streaming is not good.  For less than the 12 monthly payments to netflix, join prime with so much more to choose from.  I thought I would still use both for a while, but after I opened this, I fell in love.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Screen is more responsive<br />Color screen is very good<br />Lighter than the Nook Color<br />Prime members get soooo much more than anything the Nook has to offer.  (Lenders library, TV, Movies, etc...)<br />Personal Documents transfer so much easier (good if you want to carry a doc with your to proof or whatever)<br /><br />Cons:<br />no external volume control (Nook has it)<br />screens are not really customizable (Backgrounds, screensavers...etc.  Nook has capability)<br />You have to go home to be able to get to another screen (There is a pop up on the Nook to go from Books to magazines, etc)"
"B0051VVOB2","3","I had the original kindel and enjoyed it. unfortunately it was damaged and I up graded to the Kindel Fire. As a reader I still prefer the no glare screen. The Fire has more apps and does well, but not as good as a tablet with the Kindel app. No camera to skype or take photos. The new Kindel Fire HD answers these short comings. I would recommend it over this model"
"B0051VVOB2","5","This kindle works great! I have it from 3 years and never have a problem, it has an amazing quality that only amazon can offers you, its resistant, the colors looks great and it doesn't have any work problem. If you decide to purchase one Fire Tablet, you can started with this :)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Bye bye laptop...bye bye 4G cell phone...Kindle Fire makes both obsolete! LOVE IT! Back to cheapie cell phone phone that's just a cell phone! Wish still had pay phones...wouldn't have cell at all!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","Kindle Fire is my first device which in learning its functionality by following instruction was simple enough to do. I began by attempting to download apps and a couple of books.  I ended up buying an unwanted book.  I haven't figured out how I managed to put this book in my cart. There are a couple of features I dislike in using the Kindle Fire. One is the short life of the battery when the Wi-Fi is turned off. Another is being careful how the tablet is held. If a finger touch the side it will flip pages. Several times I had to use the back arrow to return to the page I was reading. It had flipped towards the end of the book and it took several minutes to get back to my page. By tapping the home icon to start over will only return to the last flipped page.  Turning the tablet off and then on, will automatically open to the last page it had flipped to. There may be a way to return to the last page read which I haven't learn yet - when I accidently flip pages. I recommend Amazon make a fix by ONLY using the right or left arrows to turn pages, rather than by tapping or touching the side of the page, although this is handy. Also, instructions could be more definitive.  Being in my seventies and learning new technology is very trying. Reading the Kindle Fire is easy. I have learned to flag the page I am reading. Also to remove the flag when I began reading again. Flagging pages work for me. I have learned to hold my Kindle Fire by laying it in my hand and only touching the side when ready to turn a page. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful little tablet.  I would give it a five star if the battery life would last more than part of a day."
"B0051VVOB2","2","Can not control spending by kids,family members,friends,coworkers and not to mention if someone steals it they can cook up your book and your credit card too..  Too vulnerable for IDENTITY THEFT.  I don't know it was marketing strategy or Amazon just overlooked! I have to think it has to do with marketing because they didn't correct that on the latest software update.  Bought Two and Returning Both of them. Will consider buying when all these corrected.[[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I wanted an IPad.  I really did.  I had started saving up and everything.  Being an IPhone and IPod user for years, it made sense to keep it in the family.  I also wanted the larger screen and access to the Apple apps I was already used to.  The thing is... I love Amazon.  I have shopped Amazon for years, and they have made Christmas shopping a snap for years now.  I began to really look at the value of what Amazon was offering across the board.  Not just the tablet it's self, but with Prime and the integration with the Roku player (yeah, I got it the week before it went live on PS3, but it's ok).  I considered the fact that with Amazon's \\""one day\\"" offer I could get a Kindle Fire, Amazon Prime, and a Roku for under $300.  That is still hundreds of dollars from where I would need to be for an IPad, and I was getting a whole lot more bang for my buck.<br /><br />So I took the leap of faith... and I love it. Honestly I love the Fire.  It's a great little device!  Keep in mind though, it's an entertainment device!!  Watching movies on it is great.  Music and Books?  Outstanding.  Integration with Audible??  SO AWESOME.  The Audible app is the best thing to happen to my Audible account since I signed up.  Hello sleep timer based on chapters!  Added into the value of the device is my happiness with my Prime membership, and the outstanding little streaming device Roku, but those are purchases that are up to you.  I would say adding Prime to your Kindle purchase is a pretty good idea.  New streaming material all the time, and Amazon just keeps getting better at everything.<br /><br />I can't wait for the 10 inch version of the kindle we all know is coming.  Then my wife can have this one.  She already can't wait."
"B0051VVOB2","4","fist, you should not go into the kindle thinking it's an Ipad. Yes it's close, but no Ipad.   What the kindle fire does, it does really well. The Amazon prime service is great, Lots of movies and other content right at your finger tips. The 7\\"" size is perfect to be portable and carry everywhere.   the only thing I wish this had was a Tablet like interface, but Im getting used to the amazon layout. I also wish the power button was on the top, not the bottom. i find myself hitting it while Im using the fire, turning off the screan. I also do wish there were actual volum buttons on the side, instead of having to use the software to turn the volume up or down."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Love this device...we use a stylus and it helps with speed...nook watch out...this device is a dream... Jeff is a genius... can't wait to see what's next..."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my Kindle Fire!  I'm a bedtime reader and it's much easier to deal with than my laptop and I don't always have books readily available to read.  It's so handy to carry with me when I go on appointments and it's such a conversation starter when I pull it out to read.  Everyone loves the look and feel of it and I know I've only begun to tap into the information it can actually put at my fingertips.  I do have to do more research into what to do with my \\""books\\"" once I have read them as well as the \\""library\\"" to borrow from.  This is my first \\""touch screen\\"" product and I would recommend to anyone. Another great feature is being able adjust the brightness of the screen as well as the size of the font to read by.  Thank you for a great product."
"B0051VVOB2","4","This device is truly amazing but with a few flaws. One flaw would be the lack of exturnal buttons that control volume and other neccessary buttons without using a/the touch screen. Besides the power the kindle fire is soully touch screen. But it makes up for it in other qualities such as the new silk browser which is better than i expected it runs smooth and  the best part is it pre loads parts of often visited sites. The touch screen is vary vibrant in color and very responsive to the heat sensored screen. this device is perfect for one hand cary al though this device is not the lightest it is a lot in a small package."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I've been told over and over again you get what you pay for, and in this case it was spot on. I was sucked into the tablet world with the new amazon kindle fire, price seemed good, features were said to be all that you would expect in a tablet and then some. Unit shipped as expected and delivered promptly as amazon always does. Opened it up, ready to go with my info preloaded and i was off. At first it was non responsive and had issues with WiFI at my house, ok just a small snag, then it suddenly figured it out and it was online. Touch screen is extremly poor and rarely works as expected, if i had pencil thin fingers i guess it would work better, but i dont. Update of software came through that was the fix, ddint help. Apps are clunky in general and dont run with the fludity Ipod apps do. I just am not happy with this paperweight!  Im a big amazon fan, have been for years, but they fell way short on hitting the mark on this one. I am going to take my licks, toss this thing in a drawer and buy an ipad, they cost 2x but perform 100X. Spend the cash or you will not be Happy."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I have a older Kindle and we fight for it at home so when the new one came out I knew I wanted it for my birthday but my husband had read a bad review online and wasn't so sure if he should get it for me but he saw how much I wanted it and got it for me last week. I love it, after turning 50 this year it was getting hard for me to read the older Kindle especially at night even with the light on the cover on, but the Fire is great, just bright enough but not too bright, I love the ability to download videos, the picture is so sharp, my husband was really impresssed! The sound is amazing and anytime I have been on the web it downloads the pages quickly with no problems. I think the negative reviews are coming from people expecting a tablet more than a deluxe ereader, I cannot find anything I am disappointed about, if you loved the old Kindle you really love this one!!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I received my Fire today. Perhaps the best 200 bucks I have ever spent on an electronic device. It does what is needed. The little flaws/bugs that it currently has will be fixed over time I am sure. After reading some of the \\""professional\\"" reviews, I was expecting a POS. It has exceeded my expectations."
"B0051VVOB2","3","battery is not lone enough.  I do not know how long it must be plugged into electricity to be fully charged.  Fifteen minutes or eight hours?"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I transitioned from the Kindle to the Kindle Fire.  The colors are vibrant but when reading printed material the screen is little too bright.  My eyes did get tired after reading a long period of time.  The Kindle Fire is heavier than the Kindle consequently, your hand or arm will get tired if you hold the device for awhile.  Since the color device requires more battery power to operate, the battery needs to be charged often.  Even though I stated some negatives, I would recommend the Kindle Fire because I do like it for my use."
"B0051VVOB2","2","So I purchased a Kindle Fire, a leather case, and a Kindle gift card for my 11-yr-old. He planned to buy apps, play games, and read books. Simple, right. No, ignorant me assumed it would be similar to his PlayStation account--buy the cards, spend the money, get games, have fun.   No, to buy an Amazon app like Angry Birds (ad free), I HAVE to have a credit or debit card (or such) with an expiration date loaded into my 11-yr-old's account. This is to back up the Kindle gift card that's already there just in case he wants to, or accidentally, purchases more than the gift card limit.  To top it off, his Amazon.com password characters momentarily show on the screen, before turning into an asterisk, for anyone to see while he types it in. Wow, and that's designed into the software. I'd like to have been there for that software \\""red flag review\\"".   Three hours (7 P.M. to 10 P.M.), four customer service reps, online chat and telephone--and none of them knew the answers. They were all scratching their heads, too. How about simply allowing someone to purchase items with a gift card that was properly purchased and redeemed.   Is it that complicated, or simply by design, Amazon? I'm seriously considering returning this device."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I think that the kindle fire is one of the best electronics of 201. It is a great device that is very thin and can go almost anywhere u want it to go. Con is that it has a very small screen"
"B0051VVOB2","1","1)  If you receive your Kindle as a gift, you may be in for trouble as it will be registered to the gift giver, not to you. That is what happened to me.  There was no warning in my box and, of course, the buyer never should have been able to click that final button to send it to me because Amazon knew I could not possible use the Kindle. How stupid!  If you get the Kindle as a gift, you will need to contact the gift giver and have them \\""de-register\\"" and then you will be able to register.  2)  I finally was able to register but now the Kindle is unable to \\""contact the registration server\\"" and the Kindle is totally non-functional.  Tech support says they will get back to me within two days and that they are experiencing many problems.  Be prepared for intense frustration."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My husbands son loves to read so we got this for him for christmas and he is just blowned away with it and he was showing us what it does and its unreal we are both in our 70's but it was so easy to understand and do stuff on it   he said it was the best christmas present he had ever gotten  he takes it with him where ever he goes  thanks again"
"B0051VVOB2","3","After 2 years the charging pin broke, attempted to get it fixed by 3 different computer repair store and all said this is common for Kindle.  Know one had the parts to fix but could order.  However, all said that if fixed it would probably break again.  And the cost to fix was about half the cost of the tablet.  So now I have a tablet that I can't charge.  It otherwise do worked well."
"B0051VVOB2","5","The Kindle Fire is well worth the 199.00.  Only compliant I have is that it doesn't format some pages correctly and the text can be garbled."
"B0051VVOB2","4","Kindle Fire, Full Color 7&#34; Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi...bought as a gift...quick setup...great device even for a novice. Great tablet alternative."
"B0051VVOB2","4","I purchased a Kindle Fire for myself and a Kindle for my Mother.  I wanted the added perks of a fire, (music, video, etc)<br />So far, so good.  I like the touch screen and the simplicity of the fire.  I have not mastered all of it yet but so far have not had any problems learning what I have done so far.  My only problem is that the difference in the weight of the fire compared to the kindle.  I wish the fire was a little lighter.  I like the fact that fire is totally wireless and plugs into an electrical outlet instead of having to plug it into the computer. Now my husband wants one of his own....."
"B0051VVOB2","5","The kindle fire is awesome!!!!!! This is not an iPad. Don't look at it as an iPad either and you will love it. It is made for amazon content so if you are not an amazon user you should consider another tablet. Seems well built and fairly durable. I enjoy using it and it is the perfect size for a tablet.  complaints  1. The next incarnation should have a removable storage (sd card) drive. 6 gigs is not enough for personal content.   2. More was to personalize the device. Mainly the lock screen should be a user choice. Also I would like to be able to choose what apps are on the main screen and what are in the app menu.  3. An external volume control would be nice but not a major issue.   Other then that if you plan to get any kindle device spend the money and get the fire. Also it has a great price point!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I got the Kindle for my birthday last year.  Then was upgraded to Kinle Fire for Christmas.  This is simply MAGNIFICENT.  I absolutely LOVE IT.  I strongly recommand this to anyone looking for a tablet."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I won't repeat what people are raving about, but for sure this device has so much great stuff to offer for an unreal price, a few minor cons as well, which I am sure Amazon will fix for the 2nd generation Fire.  Besides all the raves, I am simply looking forward to other color options, maybe a white or silver KindleFire in the future, and of course more capacity, I filled this one in a second, and have such a huge collection of songs specially that 8GB is just too little, 32GB would certainly be the definitive selling point for me, at which point I'd be more inclined to upload some movies from Amazon, something I've not done so far.  Either way, for now it is an amazing device, no loss at all for $199."
"B0051VVOB2","5","The sky's the limit with this awesome electronic device! Whether you want to watch videos, play music or browse the web, the possibilities are limitless. And it has FLASH!!!! Something that the ipad does NOT have. Yes I will be one of the ones that compare these two devices.  I think that it is much better than the ipad. For one, I actually like the screen size, I like the fact that I can hold it with one hand.  I think Apple should make the ipad smaller.  Let's face it...Apple sells overpriced electronic devices and computers. POINT BLANK! They are overpriced. You are paying for the name people! I do have $600 to spend but why waste money when this sweet little Kindle fire does what I need it to do and more. I love the on screen keyboard and I like that it has a dedicated / button (Yeah, I don't want to have to switch forms to press /, especially since I'm an avid web surfer). I purchased it primarily for reading but the added benefits of all of the above make it irresistable. Oh, Did I mention the price???!!... And the fact that Amazon prime members have access to thousands of free tv shows, books, and movies!! Come on, you can't get much better than this! Five stars all the way around!"
"B0051VVOB2","3","Amazon announced a system upgrade to 6.2 on November 29th.  Today is December 6th and I received my Kindle Fire which was ordered on December 4th with the 6.1 system version.  I am unable to connect to my wireless router which has multiple devices connected, is fully updated and restored to factory defaults, so, I can't update to 6.2 to see if I can achieve connectivity (*blink*).  I have no usb cable to connect the Fire to my computer because it seems to require an extra small one.  There are numerous threads on numerous forums commenting on connectivity issues with the Fire which may or may not be resolved by 6.2.  In order to determine this I will need to pay more money for a usb cable or go looking for a wireless connection that works, which I guess means Star$$'s which is irritating because I think their coffee tastes burnt.  Thanks Amazon for reminding me to always wait for the second roll-out of any electronic device.  Let's do this again next year, okay?  Not.  Edited, January 18:  Maybe some of you found this review unhelpful but I didn't.  I got a phone call from Amazon support offering to help because they saw this review.  I appreciate that.  Unfortunately, like many others the solution that ended up working was to purchase a new router.  I really didn't want to do that because there was nothing wrong with the old.  The combined cost puts me close to iPad territory, financially.  I kept the fire and have used it.  It is heavy and the battery doesn't last long but it has had some usefulness on trips.  I am still uncertain if it is a worthwhile purchase so I have revised my review to 3 stars."
"B0051VVOB2","2","The kindle fire is not a tablet, it only runs a few amazon apps. It does not run any Google apps for example like maps, navigator or docs. Disappointed in the speed and sensitivity of the touch screen. OK if you want Amazon content only."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I chose this Kindle fire bcause it was highly recommended by my son and daughter-in-law.  It really was a gift for my husband who is more technicly challenged than I am.  One of these days I will go to the library and get some help in activating this Kindle."
"B0051VVOB2","4","For the $ a best buy. The on/off button is easily hit, turning the Kindle off in the middle of a page. Volume \\""control\\""  absence. As a customer I would like an 800# to talk with a person in regard to navigating the Kindle Fire( for the not so astute)"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I really do like this new Kindle Fire.  My laptop took a dump, so I have been doing alot of stuff on my phone.  Well then I was given this Kindle Fire.  It does what I need, facebook, emails, internet, book reader, and music.  I think the only drawback is the internet speed.  But in all reality, it is just fine.  I am having a blast with it.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants an IPad without the price."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I have always been a book reader, but until recently I read maybe a book a year because I hated to bring my reading material with me when I went somewhere.<br />It has been a year since I first received my Kindle Fire as a gift (this recent purchase was a gift for someone else). Since that time, I have read more than 40 books in my spare time!<br />This is a great gift to buy for the book reader in your family.. as they will most likely not buy it themselves but also will not put it down once they find out all of the reading material at their fingertips.<br /><br />While on vacation this year we took both our laptops & Kindles, but hardly ever touched the computers and were VERY thankful to have the NetFlix app, which saved us money. Instead of paying $$$ for pay-per-view movies through the hotel, we used our account to access a library of choices without paying a .01 more.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for such a great product!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I can almost say I love this, but it has some things I hope can be corrected with software upgrade. I like the scrolling, free apps and the way it looks. I wish it would have more choice movies for PRIME customers and maybe more books to borrow or a discounted prices. The software upgrade would be nice to make the volume control more friendlier. I'm not sure if it's me or the way I tap on the screen. I sometimes have to tap a few extra times for it to recognize my touch. Otherwise, I would probable buy another one if it included a SD slot.    I wish the battery would last longer. I was watching videos and it seems it only ran 5 plus hours before it was done to 15%.  Thanks AMAZON,  Herbie_L"
"B0051VVOB2","3","Amazon is lagging in the apps department. I also find it disappointing that I needed a new kindle after less than 30 days in the first place. Sad that a $200 product doesn't last longer. The new one seems to be fine. I am used to apps on my iPhone. It seems to be much more dependable and user friendly. And no Farmville App! I can't believe you don't have Farmville! Lots of games for kids though. Also when we got the 1st kindle fire for Xmas all of the songs were $.49. now everything is $.99. And we lost everything off of the 1st device. I paid for lots of songs & apps & only got to use them for 3 weeks! I thought they wld be like apple & you cld download anything purchased to other devices but now I see you Only get what's saved to cloud. We saved everything to device so it is GONE as that device is DEAD! Frustrating!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","The Kindle Fire is almost wonderful. Incredible graphics, great interface, perfect size and almost what I expected. I bought it because I wanted a color reader that I could use to read while listening to music. What I got wasn't quite that. Don't get me wrong. I do love it, especially the price, but it does have limitations.  I'm giving the device 5 stars. It really is great - but be aware of its limitations. The marketing descriptions would not get 5 stars for truth in advertising.  My complaint is about the \\""Cloud\\"" description on the selling page. Amazon may not have meant to mislead the reader, but the \\""Unlimited Cloud\\"" only stores Amazon purchased music, etc. I have a vast music collection, especially vinyl and 78s which I digitized for my personal use. And when I mean vast, I mean over 500 albums, probably 300 or more 45s, and about 200 78s, some of which are very rare and should not be handled. Ever. (And no, I had no plans to store all that in the \\""Cloud\\"". I have a Green Drive for that.)  The \\""Cloud\\"" will not store much non-Amazon music, though the device will store some of it; but, I do not want to fill up the device with music that the \\""Cloud\\"" won't accept. The KF has no more space than my iPhone, so I know that I can't really put any music on it. I had hoped for a machine on which I could read and listen to part of my music collection, but the Kindle Fire isn't it (and I'm not going to pay $20 a month for limited \\""Cloud\\"" space of non Amazon items.)  So, it is not a tablet. Be aware of that when you purchase it and choose your apps wisely. You've only got about 6 gigs of actual storage on the device.  But, as a reader, it is wonderful and that is the primary reason I purchased it. I just wasn't happy with the \\""Unlimited Cloud\\"" marketing phraseology. It's misleading.  Oh, I have the Netflix app. The movie quality is superb.  Overall, I'm happy. I just wish the marketing had been clearer about the \\""Cloud\\""."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love this Kindle!  It's perfect for what you pay for.  Is it an IPAD?  No, then again, my sister has an IPAD and when she saw my Kindle Fire her exact words were \\""I probably only use 200.00 bucks worth of my IPAD\\""...Meaning, all those features are not needed for a basic user.  I was a little nervous about the screen brightness for reading, but it's okay.  It doubt I'll be going blind.  The speakers are loud....Great apps....Real nice.  Don't hesitate...This is gonna be huge"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I was considering getting an iPad for my wife until we saw the Kindle Fire.  This thing is great!  We both love it!  It does everything we need it for and then some.  Considering you can get 3 Kindle Fires for the price of an iPad, it was an easy decision.  It's very easy to use, easy to hold, and has a very clear picture."
"B0051VVOB2","1","This is a one-star review because Amazon doesn't let you give zero stars.  I was so excited to buy the Amazon Fire. I pre-ordered it the first day it went on sale. I have an iPad but I was thrilled to have a device that would access Amazon Prime Video as well as my Kindle books. The Fire arrived today and I couldn't wait to open the box and check it out. That was over 2 hours ago and every moment since then has been an exercise in frustration.  My Kindle refuses to register. Although it is connected to Wi-Fi and will go online, every time I attempt to register, I get an error message. I just spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support, and nothing has been resolved.   One of the tech people I spoke with decided the problem was that the Kindle software needed to be upgraded to 6.1. No problem. She waited while I downloaded the file and then I disccovered there's no USB cord included in the box. Okay, no problem. I'll use one of the half dozen usb cords I have around the house. No. It has to be the Kindle USB cord. Software updates are necessary for this device and those updates require a proprietary USB cord, and Amazon chose NOT to include that cord with the device?? How cheap can you be, Amazon?  So after working my way through 4 different people, the end result of the call was \\""sorry, we can't figure it out. You're going to have to give us a few a days to see if the engineers can find the problem.\\"" That's not a joke. That's actually where they left things.  I'll be sending it back tomorrow if I don't throw it against the wall first.  Update. Just got an email from Amazon asking if they'd solved my problem. Seriously?? NO YOU HAVE NOT SOLVED MY PROBLEM!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I purchased the Kindle Fire for my mother.  She loves it, she basically plays the games that can be downloaded.  She hasn't really used it for downloading books and movies or surfing the web.  I would say at this time we are very satisfied with the product."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Some look for high while others look for small, yes ! \\""Better technology\\"" is better for some while others look for \\""Better price\\"" !  \\"" It's what you need and not what you want \\"" and there comes the \\""big difference\\"" in the price when compared to an IPAD.  So again I say that \\""it's what you need and not what you want\\""   Good Luck Fire !!!  Oh buy the way ! Watchout from the coming Fire ;)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I have been playing with my new Kindle Fire now for a couple of weeks. I am going to have to take exception with the nay-sayers who blast the Fire becasue it is not an Ipod! Well what a surprise, it is not an Ipod but it just about is! Lacking the bigger screen is about the only difference I see.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the way the Fire handles the Internet. No problem but be warned that not all pictures will be revealed because of the limited browser! Not a problem for me as I just want to be able to use the Internet as a quick reference tool on my Fire, if I want to spend hours surfing the Internet, I'll go to my computer.<br /><br />The movies that I am downloading from Amazon play great! Not a hitch. I have the Netflix app on my Fire but I haven't tried it yet. I have downloaded music and that works great. If your not aware, music purchased off Amazon will not count against you cloud capacity. Basically their saying you have unlimited capacity for music! Awesome.<br /><br />I had to download a calendar program for the Fire and I choose Fliq Calendar which seems to be just like the calendar I have on my Android phone. It was free. Unfortunately I can not sync them without purchasing a $40 program.<br /><br />Of course the real purpose of the Fire is to read books and it functions perfectly at that. I haven't subscribed to any magazines yet so I really can't comment on the color, however if the movies are any indication, I'm sure they will be awesome.<br /><br />Some folks have complained about the fact that the on/off button gets turned off accidentally because of its placement. Here is a clue for you folks, TURN THE KINDLE FIRE UPSIDE DOWN SO THAT THE SCREEN ROTATES 180 DEGREES AND THE ON/OFF SWITCH IS NOW AT THE TOP OF THE FIRE! Wow, that was tough to figure out!<br /><br />Really, for $199 you can not beat this thing. My daughters boyfriend had his new Nook Tablet over and in comparing the two, I'd say hands down the Fire is a better deal.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I ordered this and got it the next day! The next day during Christmas season. That was incredible.<br /><br />Update 10/29/2013. OK, so now it has been almost two years since I purchased my Kindle Fire and it is still running just as good as when I first purchased it! Not a single problem has occurred! Now, since my last review, I have uploaded about 5000 songs to my Kindle Cloud and have watched hundreds of movies both from Prime and from Netflix. I've read dozens of books (both free and purchased). Never an issue! How often do I use my Kindle? EVERY NIGHT! So now that the new Fire's are out, I might purchase and upgrade!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","It does what it says it does. Really easy to set with with Wi-fi and other things. Nice screen, and Amazon has already issued a few software updates that makes it nicer.  Nice APP to get all your e-mail accounts sync'd.  Just hope it could Skype."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I have waited this long to review my Kindle Fire I received for christmas. I love it! The size and weight is perfect for my hands. The fire has a brilliant screen so reading,and watching videos is incredibly amazing. I take my fire everywhere and have never had a problem with wifi. I thought my kindle 3-g was the best but have since converted to my fire. Thank you amazon for a great product that not only works great, travels easily and fits all the requirements i wanted in a tab.

"B0051VVOB2","5","Great for internet, games, reading, sharing books, and good price. Hours of fun and games are awesome. Grat XMAS present for anyone."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My mom just came back from her North American trip with a Kindle Fire. Before buying it, she was worried it wouldn't work here in the Philippines. After 2 months of waiting and reading ALL of the positive and negative reviews on the web, I told her to go for it. She didn't need any of those expensive tablets. All she wanted was something light and portable to bring with her when travelling. Just enough to check her Facebook and email accounts, surf the web, and maybe play some games and read a few magazines on. After having used it since last week, I can truthfully write that this is exactly what the Kindle Fire was built to do! I have to say, after setting the Fire up for her, I was really wanting one of my own.   The Silk browser is super fast. Not buggy at all, like what the other reviewers have noted. Reading blogs and articles on it has been really easy, and the display is fantastic! I've used an iPad, iTouch, and an iPhone before and the display is close enough that you wouldn't really expect a display so good on such a cheap tablet. I also got a few magazines for her to read (Architectural Digest, Everyday Living, Bon A Petite) and after 3 hours of reading the magazines and part of a novel in a room with a fluorescent light, I had no eye strain to complain about. My mom also tried reading the novel for a few hours and was really pleased with how easy it was to read from. She usually complains of eye strain after reading from her laptop, but she was very happy after reading from the Kindle Fire.  After reading a lot of complaints from different people about how a lot of Amazon's services not working outside of the US, I decided to try and see what exactly will and won't work from here in the Philippines.Let me first clarify that I did use a US credit card with a US billing address to make my purchases over a local IP address. To summarize the results of my experiment, cloud services for MP3's work, purchasing and downloading MP3's from outside the US work, cloud services for books and news stand works, purchases of books and from news stand works, streaming of videos DO NOT WORK outside of the US (but we already knew this before buying the Kindle Fire), purchasing and downloading of apps outside of the US ALSO WORKS. So for all those who are wondering, please read and re-read this paragraph again. If any of these are deal-breakers for you in terms of purchasing the Fire, then think hard. For us, these services were just bonuses since a lot of the things we wanted weren't tied to these services.   Regarding the apps available, I've already downloaded about 30 apps from Amazon and also from outside Amazon. Just by doing a little research on how to do it, I was able to load plenty of apps from outside the Amazon app market without any rooting. If you really don't want to use any of your mental faculties about loading apps, then spend the extra few hundred dollars and buy a more expensive tablet.  About the device itself, the dual-core chip is super fast and the touch display has a quick response time. The 7-inch display is great for us since it's just like holding a book. If my mom and I wanted a bigger display, we would be using our netbooks. The body is solid and it doesn't feel badly made. And for all those complaining about the power button being easy to accidentally pressed, just turn the display upside-down and problem solved. Personally, I never had any problems with the power button, and neither did my mom.  With how great the Kindle Fire is, my mom is planning to buy another one when she goes back to the US in a few months. This time, it'll be for me to use since I keep on borrowing her Kindle Fire. I can't wait!"
"B0051VVOB2","1","The fact that purchases are not and cannot be password protected is perplexing to say the least, and for me is extremely disappointing.  I bought this device for my son at his request as his birthday present (he will be 12).  I don't want him making unauthorized purchases, I don't want his friends making unauthorized purchases, and I don't want it to be lost or stolen and have someone else making purchases before I can do damage control!!  What a bad judgement call on Amazon's part.  Time for a new update, passwords are cool in this day and age."
"B0051VVOB2","2","If you have parents who are accustomed to a computer and an iPad, they will have difficulty with the Kindle Fire. Me and my siblings are aways trying to get it to work properly. Sometimes it is tempermental and won't even log on! If it had cost more than $199 I would return it. I'll just get them the new iPad."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Finally, I don't have to hold my 1st generation heavy iPad to read in the night. The only drawback is the screen, not high resolution and too much glare."
"B0051VVOB2","5","For the price, it's handy to sit on the couch, go on the net, use apps, read a book, and e-mail.  A great size for when you are doing other things (ie: child napping on you).  There are a couple of glitches in the software, but I'm sure they'll be worked out over time."
"B0051VVOB2","4","My college-aged daughter loves it, uses it for both reading and internet.  Battery life is very good, does movies, FB etc.  Very responsive. IMO, all these tablets/iPads etc. are for casual / social activity.  Don't expect to do serious typing like on a laptop, and who wants to plug in a separate keyboard.  Hunt and peck on a virtual keyboard is a pain for me (though it's as easy as any other tablet). Some have complained that there is no volume control 'button'.  To me this is an asset.  My 'nandroid' (Nook Color running Android OS) has volume button and I keep hitting it while holding the tablet.  I;d prefer having it as a software control.  I do wish there was an way to print from these devices directly (none are really set up for it).  And I really think a camera should have been part of it.  Not because I'd use the camera all that much, but capturing those barcodes/boxes to make 'shopping' easier should have been a no-brainer for Amazon since internet sales is the real driving force for Amazon's entry.  Steve Jobs may have thought the 7\\"" was too big to compete against Smartphones and too small to compete with the larger iPad, but most people who have used these love the extra 'portability' and the ability to show off their images at a decent size.  Just stick the Fire in your cargo pants and off you go!  Interestingly, now that Jobs is gone and Amazon has sold a million of them every week for over a month, Apple has hinted they'll come out with one after all... around summertime.  Boy, that didn't take long!"
"B0051VVOB2","2","Amazon has always, in my opinion, one of the best companies with excellent prices, service and products. However, the kindle fire is truly a major.disappointment. I have owned it for two weeks now, and have been desparately hoping that it would slowly grow on me. Yet, I have to say, that I have become more and more frustrated with the product. Here are the reasons why:  1. The size itself is somewhere between an iphone and an ipad. It is too small to  feel comfortable viewing the content on this 7\\"" screen, while too big to hold it easily with one hand. It kind of falls in the middle of nowhere.  2. The keypad is not a user friendly one. The space bar and dot key are located way too close to each other, making it very.difficult to type smoothly.  3. The web browser is way too slow. I am not being unrealistic trying to compare with an Ipad or computer, but seriously, it is ridulously slow, making it a pain to surf the web or even something as basic as checking emails.  4. The apps are very limited. This has to do with Android's platform, which targets probably less than 15% of the smartphone/tablet market.  5. The fire gets very warm after just a 15 min use.  6. It also has a poor touchscreen sensitivity. It takes a couple of touches to get it going.  All in all, Amaazon, you have truly disappointed me this time!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I was amazed at how simple this was to start up and beging using. Almost as soon as I took it out the box for our daughter and turned it on, it 'found' the Wireless connection and prompted me to enter the password. Once this was done it configured itself and was ready for use. Very simple. Made the perfect Christmas gift."
"B0051VVOB2","1","I was waiting anxiously for the Kindle Fire to come out, I thought that Amazon would know better than to launch another middle of the road device. What a disappointment, if you want to compromise on quality for the price look elsewhere, if you can spend a little more buy the iPad. The device is sluggish, unresponsive and frustrating - PASS."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I never thought I would read as much as I do now. I was never a huge reader but now with my Kindle Fire I read a lot more then I ever had before. I love and would recommend it to anyone."
"B0051VVOB2","1","On the second Kindle Fire since Christmas. The first one would not charge, cable is very loose in the charge port. Returned to store and given a second one. The same problem is experienced and now taking the second Fire back for an exchange. Time to look at something else."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Awesome product. Great for reading, browsing the Internet, and playing games which is all I would use a tablet for anyway. I don't understand !why everyone is griping...its s great product at a great price!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I absolutely LOVE my Kindle Fire - BUT, why in the world didn't they make it with Free 3G like a couple of their other Kindle's.  There are so many wonderful features of the Fire, but when there is no WiFi available, you are limited to it's uses!  Just say'n."
"B0051VVOB2","2","The port into which the electrical charging cable is inserted became inoperable, possibly because a user tried to insert the wrong cable.  I clicked on &#34;return or replace&#34;  on this page but was told that the warranty had run out.<br /><br /> I don't mind paying to have it repaired, but no such option was offered.  Nothing is wrong with the device except that I can't charge it because the head of the charging cable doesn't fit into the port any more.  It seems a pity to throw away a device that works perfectly just because a minor piece of  the cable interface has been bent out of shape, making it impossible to give it a new charge.  Isn't there any way to get it  repaired or to get a replacement part?"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I have owned an Ipad 1, Archos 101, Motorola Xoom, Viewsonic Gtab, Acer Iconia A500, Nook Color, and now the Kindle Fire.  I am not an \\""Apple guy\\"", but I'm not a hater either.  The Ipad is a wonderful device.  But at 500 bucks on the bottom end, it's not for everyone.  The build quality of other Android devices really hurt them, including the 101 and the Gtab.  My personal favorite is the Acer Iconia, but you are still talking DOUBLE the price of the Kindle Fire.  So it's really hard to beat at 200 bucks.  It has some glaring limitations, but has a lot of pluses as well for the price point.  Basically, if you want to spend 500-600 bucks, get an Ipad.  If you want Android's premium tablet, get an Iconia, Galaxy Tab 10.1, or the Xoom, etc.  If you want something around 200 or under, Fire is the best option for you.  Pros:  Design, Build Quality, Screen quality, Amazon integration, Simple interface, Netflix App, can hold in one hand, good for reading (although not in direct sunlight), will fit in your pocket (most men or larger pants), decent battery life.  Cons:  Screen smaller than I would like for watching movies, both speakers on one side of device when watching in landscape mode (the way you watch all videos), no SD card slot, no camera, no gps, no HDMI out, no Google Marketplace (although you can sideload some apps and there's an Amazon AppStore), no physical volume buttons or home key, low storage amount.  '"
"B0051VVOB2","3","Setup is a little involved since we have a Kindle 3G and had to separate the 2 devices but keep them under one account but each is registered to a different person an email id.  If you download an Ebook it is found under BOOKS, but if you move an Ebook from your PC it goes under DOCS ...   If you download a Video it is found under Video, but if you move a Video from your PC it goes under Gallery as a picture ...  Does not make sense ...    You can not remove items from the Main Screen ... ex: If you delete a Book it still shows up on the main screen...   It would be nice if the Kindle came with an Anti-glare screen cover or gave an option to have one put on.  The Fire works well after you figure it out."
"B0051VVOB2","3","One of the main problems I have with the Fire is that you can not increase font size inside apts - including the amazon store. Very unfriendly to older users. Another is that it come with a per-installed Facebook apt that you cannot remove.  I tried and tried and finally called support where I was informed that Facebook was built in and can not be deleted.  I wonder how much Facebook paid Amazon to force this on buyers."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I've just started to use it but think I am going to be very pleased.  I even figured out how to set it up and I am definitely \\""electronically\\"" challenged."
"B0051VVOB2","4","Once rooted, there is plenty of support for different roms on this device. The functionality was substantially increased when using stock android."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My Kindle Fire is beloved. I use it every day, and I'm still experimenting with all the apps. The web browser is great, and videos/songs render super fast for ideal streaming. I'd suggest this item to a friend."
"B0051VVOB2","3","I must say that I am quite disapointed with my experience so far. The device has been really good but there have been a few things that I've had issues but by far my worst experience has been with the customer service reps.   Issue 1 - fetching email via push doesn't work. The email app doesn't fetch emails unless I have the app open which is basically manual. (defeats the purpose of fetch). The customer service rep says that \\""this device is not meant to handle multi tasking\\"". This is truly a lie since I can use pandora and browse the web, among other things. CS just made something up. An android gingerbread device can obviously multi task.  Issue 2 - I have  6.5 gigs of usable space in the device, but if I use any more than 5 gigs, I get a warning that i'm running low on memory and doesn't allow other programs to access internal memory (1.5 gigs, seriously...my pc doesn't warn me until 50 megs or so but the kindle is so high powered that it needs all this space). At any rate, the customer service guy says \\""1 gig is exclusive for amazon.com content\\"". This absolute makes no sense considering I've never heard anyone say this before. And I don't think it's legal for you to limit the space for your own content. If it where I'm sure Apple would only let you fill the ipad with \\""purchases\\"" from itunes, which isn't the case.  I don't appreciate being told false responses to get me off the phone. Frankly amazon should have tested this device a lot more before releasing. Also, they should train their CS people a lot better so they can actually give you an answer not just a way to end the call.  The device"
"B0051VVOB2","4","Good little tablet.not a computer geek,love to brouse the web. IT is not an Ipad, but would recommend for the money a kindle fire for the average person. LOVE IT!!!!!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Just ordered it on a whim but am so glad I did.  It allows me to read in bed & not disturb my husband, check my email & facebook. Since my phone looses it charge by late afternoon, it gives me an option of not using my phone as much! Love it & have recommended it to others!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I love this tablet and it does what it says it does for the price you can't beat it. I would give if 5 stars if only you could get a java app in the app market place. I cannot get into one of my favorite chatrooms on the Kindle Fire but I can on my HTC sensation android phone. I sure hope someone is working on a java app for this tablet."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I installed this app on my Kindle Fire and it works great and I can get Heartbleed detection result for my device and installed applications.  A great tool to have on your tablet."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I did much research before choosing the Kindle Fire. I was at first drawn to the iPad, of course, because of all the hype. I went to the Apple store and played around with it - it's shiny with lots of bells and whistles. However, I chose the Kindle Fire and I don't regret it.<br /><br />The most obvious upside to this choice is the money saved - $200 for the Kindle Fire vs. $500+ for an iPad.<br /><br />Other benefits:<br /><br />Movies and TV: As an Amazon Prime Member, I'm enjoying free instant streaming movies and tv shows on a daily basis. The quality is excellent; I was blown away by the first video I watched. The streaming is great. I haven't experienced any lags or freezing issues. If you have a NetFlix account, movies stream well from the NetFlix app as well.<br /><br />Decent Battery Life: Battery life is good. You can easily get through a full movie without worrying about losing juice. It also charges fairly quickly.<br /><br />Weight: The weight of the Kindle Fire as compared to the newest (or even older models of iPad) wins hands-down. It's very light-weight and comfortable to use, whether in a sitting up or laying down in bed position. The Fire also appears to be a sturdy-build that you won't have to worry about.<br /><br />Surfing: No issues whatsoever while surfing the web.<br /><br />Ease Of Use: Even a novice will be able to use the Kindle Fire out of the box. If you need extra help, \\""Kindle Fire, The Missing Manual\\"" can be purchased for under $12.00. I think it's worth it because it gives you great tips for maximizing usage of the Fire.<br /><br />Extras: The pricing for books, movies, and apps is fantastic. You can easily add to your Kindle Fire without breaking the bank. Regarding books, I've built a 250+ library in only a few weeks for FREE. The free book downloads can't be beat! There are also countless books that are $1.99 and less. Movie rentals are less expensive than Pay-Per-View. Email, reading and saving documents, calendar, contacts - it's all here! The speakers are stereo and music/movies sound amazing!<br /><br />If you are looking for a tablet to create movies, photoshop work -- this is probably not for you and the iPad would be better equipped for that. However, if you want a good all-in-one tablet at a decent price for movie watching, reading, organizing, surfing the web, listening to music, go with the Kindle Fire! I'm very happy with my choice!"
"B0051VVOB2","5","This is working for me.  There's a bookstore a comic bookstore a newstand mixed in with videos, music and a few games.  The battery lasts well enough for me through the day.  The Silk program works well on the internet.  I'm getting used to the typing program the more I use it."
"B0051VVOB2","5","this is great! have a fantastic time with using it to read ebooks and surf the net when I don't want to bring my laptop."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I purchased my Kindle Fire a couple of months ago. I initially went through the problems one sees with using a new device. Since I purchased a few other books I've learned it is very easy to use. This unit has a multitude of books, applications, web access and functions that would be of use to anyone. Although I'd highly recommend this device I'd would not recommend it for children due to risk of it being damaged. I think it's a wonderful device high above other similiar devices. I'd buy it again if I had to make the choice for a similiar device."
"B0051VVOB2","1","The functionality of the Kindle is great. The main issue is that the charger breaks inside of the device incessantly. So if you buy one, make it two while the other is being repaired."
"B0051VVOB2","5","My IPOD was no longer working well and I really didn't feel I needed the functions of an IPAD.  My husband has an IPAD and I just wouldn't use it the way he does but I wanted to watch movies.  When the Fire came out I decided to go with it because it had a larger screen for watching movies then the IPOD and was still small enough to carry in a small bag.  It also let me download pictures and of course books and music.  I've had it for about 3 weeks now and really love the Fire.  I will say it does not turn on as fast as the IPAD or IPOD and the wireless doesn't seem as strong.  My IPOD got wireless in my bedroom but the Kindle fire has problems there so I have to go closer to the wireless connection.  Not a major problem but could be food for thought for Kindle if they want to compete with the IPAD."
"B0051VVOB2","5","Debated over and over whether to move up from kindle to fire.  Really glad we did.  My wife uses it all the time and is really pleased with the item."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I had high hopes, but the Kindle Fire is a piece of junk. I'm sure Amazon will sort out the issues with time, but they really should have spent more time polishing the details of the hardware and software. I wish there were volume controls. I don't like the placement of the on/off switch (I turn the Fire off accidentally all the time). The whole thing feels really slow, really laggy. The first iPad smoked this thing speed wise. It's not worth the money IMO."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I love my Kindle keyboard, so as soon as they came out with the Fire, I knew I'd be getting one.  I love the color and the fact that I can read in the dark because of the screen illumination.  And I love the touch screen!  there are so many different kinds of apps available.  I found one that my 2 and a half year old granddaughter just loves!  I can't believe how quickly she is learning how to use the kindle.  It's truly a great product.  Amazon Prime is a nice bonus for the first month.  I'll be subscribing before my trial period is over.  Thanks Amazon for another wonderful product!"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I have both this model and a 2nd gen. HD.  Let me say the HD is considerably faster. Games, video and even web pages will load super fast and play much more smoothly.  That being said I recommend getting the Fire HD or the HDX if you can afford it."
"B0051VVOB2","1","DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I purchased a kindle fire for my wife and have regretted it ever since. Never mind that they send the kindle fire in it's own box (it came tattered), when she tried to load her ESV study bible's notes and highlights it was taking well over 60 seconds every time. We called amazon and they had us do a hard reset, a device wipe, and still same results. they said they would send us a brand new one (it was refurbished), it came practically opened with the box ripped up all over sitting on our front porch. I brought it in, booted it up, and same result. I really wanted to like this product, but alas, it is trash."
"B0051VVOB2","5","For the money, this is such a great device!<br /><br />Favorite features:<br />It's backlit, which means I can use it for nighttime reading without a lamp - much appreciated by my wife.<br />The dictionary and search lookup features - I am reading a history from 1855 and I'm able to look up the definition of archaic words instantly<br />Wifi for everything Internet, including Netflix, Amazon Prime (well worth the annual subscription)<br />Re-size text and change font capability - very cool<br /><br />Not so favorite features:<br />The Lock/Unlock screen rotation - the little gear icon is so small and up in the corner where most outer cases get in the way, it's hard to hit it"
"B0051VVOB2","5","I must say once i got my Kindle Fire, turned it on and was very easy to follow didn't even have to go to the instruction manual its so user friendly. I download games, books and more all on the Cloud because i don't want to use on space on my device. Screen is very heavy duty and thick. Overall i give it 5 stars."
"B0051VVOB2","1","I pre-ordered the Kindle Fire and have been patiently waiting for it to ship.  Two weeks ago I noticed that it was now available through local retailers.  I figured, why not buy it locally and just cancel the Amazon order since it hasn't shipped yet?  I did so, but promptly received an email from Amazon saying that the order could not be cancelled because it is being processed.  It is now two weeks later, my Fire still has not shipped, but it is being 'processed' and the order will not be cancelled.  I've been told that I can refuse delivery once it shows up at my door step or can return it after accepting delivery, but that makes no sense.  I have been in contact with Amazon three times (email x2, telephone x1) and every time I got the same response.  If there is such a back order on the Kindle Fire I would think Amazon would be anxious to accept my cancellation so that they could use the Fire intended for me to fill some other standing order - especially since I am still buying their product, just not buying it from their site.    This rigid adherence to their stance, flying in the face of reason, has me questioning whether this is a site with which I would want to do business in the future."
"B0051VVOB2","4","This review will be short. May update, after I have more time to play with it.  I just received my FIRE a couple weeks ago. I am enjoying learning more about the device as I go along.  I am a PC user as a primary device.I don't have an I Phone. Just a basic cell. I purchased this device. After sitting in a hospital waiting for a grandbaby to be born.Son in Law ,had an I PAD .That he was watching Netflix, while waiting. I held the device. And to me, personally. It was a bit too large and chunky for what I wanted.I wasn't looking for a ton of APPS.Just the ability to stream video when away from home.Read books on it.As well as have games that one of our grandbabies. (  5 yrs old ) could play.  I find the image/video quality to be very good. Volume could have been boosted somehow. So I have bought a headset to listen to movies on.( really wish that hadn't  been a necessity in order to enjoy this feature.)  Now when playing games on it.Not such an issue.Not sure as to why there is a difference between the 2 . Fully charged.Barely had enough battery life to stream one movie.We are talking 90 mins.Far cry from 7 hr claims with no Wi-FI connected.Thought would at least get 4 hours life while WI-FI connected.Only watching 1 movie before having to recharge is annoying.  Another issue/frustration,to me.The fact that Book Covers are always viewable.From the Main Screen. Versus having a way to private organizing them away from peering eyes. As some book covers are inappropriate for the 5yr old to see. Prefer to gave books/games/videos all set to separate tabs. That are password enabled.( Hope I am making the issue understandable)  As for the free PRIME Movies /streaming. I feel it has a very good variety of TV Shows as well as Movies. And the fact that it is included with a Prime Account. It also makes it a very affordable. Cheaper  than Netflix or Hulu Plus.Though this has apps for Netfix and others.It does not have an app for HULU Free.At least that I have been able to find.Another Book issue.Is when hooked to my PC.I am unable to sort the Book Titles by name. To back up onto my PC. ( this would be a way to temp remove book covers from being viewable to younger user of my device.)  All things considered.It is a great device for it's price."
"B0051VVOB2","1","I was really looking forward to getting the Kindle Fire. I wanted it for browsing, for music, for books, etc. I don't need an iPad--nor do I want to spend $600. On the other hand, I want reliable WiFi access. This thing is testing my hatred for returning things. It drops my WiFi connection so often I feel like throwing it into the trash. Why produce a thing with such promise and send it out with such a debilitating flaw? Every other wireless device I use has a very simple set it and forget it wireless setup. This one pretends to have that--but it lies. It allows you to set it, and then, guess what? IT forgets it! Hah! One second I'm connected, the next I'm not. Great! The whole rely on the cloud thing kinda goes out the window when I CAN'T STAY CONNECTED.  I don't have this issue with any other device I use. I have the latest update. How can they talk about streaming movies and music using a device that could cut out at any moment?  Did no one test this thing before sending it out the door?  The only reason I am not sending it back (today) is that I am lazy when it comes to returning things, and stupidly optimistic that, maybe, it might just work right, someday. . .  I feel like I've been scammed.  01/20/12  Well, I've had it for about one month and Wi-Fi still comes and goes. Talk about buyer's remorse. One of the reasons I bought the Kindle was to reduce the number of devices I have with me in our living room--to avoid using my laptop or iPhone for simple browsing. Well, I still have to keep both nearby because I can't rely on the Kindle to maintain it's WiFi connection.  Even as I write this I am thinking about browsing around for another tablet.  Sad."
"B0051VVOB2","2","[[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]  I've been an Amazon Kindle user since the original Kindle 1 and have owned all the major subsequent models. I still use the Kindle 2 and my wife swears by the Kindle 3. So, we've looked to the Kindle Fire with great anticipation, since it would let us read now in poor light without having to use Kindle iPad apps. The first surprise when I started up the Kindle Fire was that I'd have to re-download all my currently active books. This means searching throughout the hundreds of books in my archive and is a nuisance but not a serious problem.  The second surprise was that previously purchased Kindle applications could not be downloaded to the Kindle Fire; it just can't run them. This was a deal-breaker for my wife, who enjoys playing word games between reading sessions. The third surprise was that the Web browser was slow and limited. The screen is too small for most Web sites and the system Amazon uses to render pages in the cloud does nothing to fit the content onto the screen in a legible size. So, forget Web surfing from the device. Fourth, there is no built-in email app that I could find.   Lastly, and most importantly,  I was shocked to see that the Kindle Fire was pre linked to my Amazon account with absolutely no control to limit access. Not only that, one-click shopping was preset even though I've studiously avoided it for the past eight years and always turn it off whenever Amazon tries to inveigle me into it. It's just too easy to push a wrong button. And if I lose my Kindle Fire, my account becomes accessible to anyone who finds it. This will make Kindle Fires prime targets for thieves. I thought Amazon was more considerate of our wallets and our privacy. I have items in my shopping basket that I'm considering as Christmas presents; I don't want my wife to have easy access to those.  So, I'm disappointed and have decided that life without the Kindle Fire will be easier than life withit. Back it goes!  At least Amazon is very considerate in processing returns. :-)"
"B0051VVOB2","5","If you're a PRIME Customer, this thing is well worth the money, because you get free access to all kinds of stuff in the amazon marketplace.  Free Movies and TV Shows are worth the price of admission alone!  It has a web browser, and you can play many apps that are the exact same as on the apple products.  Perfect size, great battery life."
"B0051VVOB2","1","Good morning,  Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback on the two Amazon Kindle Fires i procured for my 7 & 10 year old.  We now reside reside in The Gambia in West Africa after 27 years in the USA.  We were very excited to get the kindles and unfortunately there are too many restrictions to access software because of the geographical location we reside in.  Below is an excerpt from Amazon.  We would like to return the product and purchase ipads in lieu due t0 the restrictions.  We will also need some type of extended arrangement as shipping these items from here takes a while due to the distance.  We thank you for your cooperation.

"B0051VVOB2","5","I read all the negative reviews about, the kindle fire and yet I went to best buy and bought it. And guess what all thouse reviews were so wrong. Because My kindle fire is the next best thing to the internet. I used to think, if I get this device i'll miss the joy of holding a real book, i was so wrong, because unlike the book, the kindle adjusts to u, especially while reading in bed. Plus there is so much stuff that you can download for free (ha ha NOOK COLOR would not let you do that, they make you pay for downloading something as basic as a calender). Doesn't heat up after 20 mins as one review read, and the battery lasts forever (I charge mine every other day). I love you Amazon, for giving us the Fire.... you will always be my favorite website. so worth 199/-"
"B0051VVOB2","2","I hate to be so critical..... but the screen size is too small and my whispernet is sooooo slowwwwwwwww i have to download wifi....<br /><br />i got an ipad for my B-day - and it's just so much better... and with more apps.<br /><br />TechBetty"
"B0051VVOB2","4","I purchased the K-Fire because of the color, but decided to get a K-Touch, too,  because I wanted to read books in eInk rather than lcd.  I use the Fire for news, playing Angry Birds, reading magazines and for some books where illustrations are important like recipes.  The only complaint I have is the short life of the battery, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  I find I have to charge it nightly."
"B0051VVOB2","2","I was hoping this $200 device would be a nice substitute for a netbook since it has a touchscreen, do web browsing, email, simple stuff.  For the most part, it serves that purpose. But that's about all the good things I can say about the Kindle Fire.  My complaints/disappointments:  - Slow response. Having an iPhone 4s, I can definitely feel the difference in lack of responsiveness with the Fire. On the Fire, it feels slow and laggy.   - Touchscreen is not precise. I have to press buttons more than once on many occasions; especially the smaller buttons inside apps. Trying to highlight text (for copy&pasting) becomes very difficult because I can't accurately position the selection cursor.  - Device doesn't come with a micro-USB cable to hook up to PC so you have to run out and buy one (unless you have one handy). Why not do something like the iPhone? USB cable + USB power adapter?  - Amazon Silk is not what it's cracked up to be.  Slow. Not impressive at all. And I use 802.11n at home.  - The device does NOT show videos you download to it. Only videos bought from Amazon appear in your Videos. BIG disappointment. MP3s, fortunately, do appear in your Music.  - Amazon Prime was a scam. If you've used your Prime Trial within the last 12 months, you don't get to try it out again. And it's only for one month... For some reason, I thought it was 1 year trial.  - Children's books (Kindle edition) cost a fortune! So why the heck does a Kindle Fire version cost more than print version?? E.g. \\""Brown Bear\\""  - Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't find the place to change the wallpaper images.  - Auto-zoom (when you double-tap an area in browser) is NOT intelligent. It basically just zooms in, but not smart zoom to fit text."
"B0051VVOB2","3","All very well if you live in the US. What about us devoted Kindle users in Australia!<br />How long are we going to have to wait?<br />Please let us know.<br />If we do not have full access to the Kindle Fire's resources, then maybe we should return the device and go to a tablet that is more welcoming!<br />But we do need to know in good time, please.<br />Martin Wilson"
"B0051VVOB2","5","Great buy and got fast shipping, grandkids loved it. Now I just have to keep them stocked up and books and games."
"B0051VVOB2","5","I own a 3G Kindle which is great, and the Kindle Fire is everything I had hoped it would be and more.  Highly recommended."
"B0051VVOB2","3","I was pleased to purchase a Kindle Fire for my brother's birthday and paid for upgraded shipping to get the Fire to him in time for his birthday. I received an email from Amazon saying the fire had shipped, however UPS had not received the package or even so much as ha record that a tracking label was created--the kindle never shipped.  On the day it was supposed to arrive I called Amazon and was told that there was nothing they would do until 5 days AFTER the product was supposed to have been delivered. When I said that I had paid for upgrade shipping and wanted it refunded, since they failed to provide a service I paid for, I had to go through THREE supervisors to get the shipping refunded. And when they finally agreed to give me back my money, I was told that it would be a \\""one time\\"" courtesy. The also refused to send a replacement kindle until the 5 days had passed.<br /><br />5 days after the initial delivery date, the kindle still had not arrived. I called and had to speak to 2 more supervisors just to get someone to agree to send out a replacement. I was told, rather rudely, that if for some reason both Kindles shipped, I would need to bear the cost of shipping one of them back.<br /><br />Amazon finally agreed to ship the replacement, but I had to fight to get them to send it out next day (now a week after my brother's birthday).<br /><br />The product is alright--a cheap stop-gap between nothing and an iPad. Considering the customer service I received, however, I will not be purchasing any significant items from Amazon any longer."
"B0051VVOB2","4","Great alternative to the iPad! Works great for reading and games and is reasonably priced. Wish it had 3G and more apps. Will come in time i'm sure."
