"B0083PWAPW","4","0","0","OK, so it's not an iPad, but it does 95% of everything an iPad does for a fraction of the price. Despite having its OS neutered by amazon into something close to garbage, this is an excellent tablet for the price. So before you waste your hard earned dollars on something just because it has a piece of fruit stamped on the back, do yourself a favor and check this one out.<br />A few gripes: the built in video and browser apps are terrible 3rd part ones have to be installed, the carousel is kind of a nice touch, but it makes it near impossible to personalize with shortcuts and links, despite being \\""android\\"" it is not Google friendly, which is a pain.<br />Recommendations to Amazon: I can get around most of the issues with this product except for the inability to link with Google apps and products easily. Make google your friend, and rule the tablet world.","0.14","0.767","0.093"

I was online with an Amazon tech tonight, hoping that they could resussitate it, but no luck.  They offered me a discount on a new one, which I appreciate, but I am not sure I want to be burned again.  $199....down the drain!","0.162","0.686","0.152"

"B0083PWAPW","3","3","2","I have to say that I never intended to get a kindle fire. But after my neice got the Fire for $159 I really liked the new design and thought it was cool. So I decided to buy one and decided to upgrade to the Fire HD. I have to say it is nice looking and is pretty cool but I am kinda disappointed in it. I do not believe it deserves 5 stars for a few reasons.<br />- First off I can not understand why they can not supply a faster charger for this thing?! 13.5 hours to charge is ridiculous!!! Who really wants to wait half a day to play with it again. You can buy the rapid charger, which I did and that's another story I will get to, but if you do not buy at same time as kindle it will cost you 19.99, crazy!! If your going to get a Fire buy the rapid charger!!!! I did buy the charger at the same time and it was shipped the same day but guess what I still have not got my charger. I am a prime member and I should have gotten it the same day as my kindle but I'm still waiting.<br />- Another thing is I charged my Fire all night and played with it for about 4 to 5 hours and it was dead and needed another charge so now I can play with it again tomorrow. Yes I did download 3 songs to it from my cloud and we checked out one video for about 3 minutes. I downloaded 3 apps and then shut off the wireless. I played angry birds and read a few pages from a book. But after 4 to 5 hours I had to recharge. Seems a little nuts for a device that costs $199 to have such fast battey run down.<br />- The most unbelieveable thing is the camera that come with your Fire that you paid $199 for does NOT work!! That's right folks you have to buy a app that makes it work. I could NOT believe it. I still can't! I could not figure out how to turn it on until I read that you have to buy an app for it to work. It's nuts!!!<br />- I can not understand why you do not get some kind of book to read how to use the stupid thing. I went to the amazon site and found the info on how to use it but come on and small, short book would have been nice.<br /> I guess overall its not a bad device and its kinda neat. The picture is nice and the speakers are really nice but those things alone does not just giving it 5 stars. I feel it would have been a 5 star if the charger was included, the battery was a little longer and the damn camera actually worked without buying an app to make it work! I'm a little disappointed in this Kindle, especially since I paid $199 for it. I love Amazon but they really goofed on this one.<br /><br />**It was brought to my attention that there is an app under \\""photos\\"" at the top corner for the camera. I did not see it and I will have to try tomorrow to find it because I have to wait 13 hours for my fire to charge. I will update if I figure it out. This is why a book with this kind of information would be nice to have, Amazon!l, short book would have been nice.<br /> I guess overall its not a bad device and its kinda neat.

Email, Words-with-friends, etc. work great on the HDX. Instead of replacing the Fire HD, I use both the HD and HDX now because the HDX does not have the Zinga Poker app, which is on the HD device. The Mayday (which is unbelievably great) rep said Zinga Poker has not written the spec for the HDX yet. If I had know the HDX is missing apps I am used to playing on the HD, I would have not upgraded to the HDX, until everything that I had on the HD was available on the HDX.

"B00BWYQ9YE","2","3","1","I have been an iOS user since the very first iPad. I also own an iPhone. However; I pretty much hate the User Interface of iOS 7 and I find the phone too small for web browsing. My iPad is so old, that web pages overload the internal memory and cause crashes. So, I decided the time was right to start exploring Android. I found the Amazon interface to be confusing. Too much going on. I also really don't like how I am limited to the Amazon store (but I do understand the business model of them offering the tablet cheaper for that reason).  In the end, I figured I could live with the shortcomings for $155. I was wrong.<br /><br />The problem is not Android. I am going to end up buying a Nexus. I also have decided I do not like the 7 inch tablet form factor but for some reason, I found web pages in the Nexus 7 inch easier to read than the Fire HDX 7 inch.

"B0051VVOB2","5","6","5","I bought the Fire as a Christmas present to myself. I had some second thoughts after reading some of the negative reviews. I held off until Christmas to unwrap the package and I couldn't have been more surprised. The Fire has operated as promised. Too many reviewers tried to compare the Fire with an IPAD, which it is not. It is exactly what Amazon advertised. I find the Silk browser to be as fast as IE 8 on my desktop, the display is awesome, steaming content plays without interruption, and using the Fire is intuitive. As promised the Fire is a media consumption device with the added ability to access the internet and email. It allows me avoid booting up my desktop just for a quick email check or web search. I am sure there are more apps that I could install, but so far everything that I want or think I need has been available--including Angry Birds. There are still features I haven't used, such as the Cloud, but as time goes on I expect the Fire will handle them seemlessly. The only thing I find even a bit disappointing is a rather narrow selection of free media on Prime. The hype with Prime was there were thousands of free video and text available. I am sure there are if one was to count, but the question is how many of them would a consumer really want to view or read.  All in all the Fire is a great buy and I will most likely purchase a second one for my wife.","0.129","0.772","0.099"

"B0051VVOB2","4","3","2","I have both an iPad and a kindle fire. They both have their places. The fire does exactly what was advertised, no need to bash it for being a value oriented tablet.  I think the fire is going to be great for traveling thanks to its small size and light weight. There are a few quirks with the software but this is common with a brand new device.  The default news stand view is a little annoying  it would be nice to be able to customize the main interface.  This does however keep the device better organized than the iPad.  If the amazon app store expands and they bring instant videos to PS3 it will really help the case for amazon's tablet market.","0.155","0.772","0.073"
"B0083Q04IQ","4","0","0","I recently passed 30 years at work and one of the items available for my service award was a 2nd gen Kindle Fire.  Got it for free.  Sure cannot beat that price.  So far I am happy with the device itself.  Was easy to set up and get working.  Connected to my home network with no problems.  Was already a member of Amazon Prime, so I downloaded a freebie short story from the Kindle Lending Library to make sure that worked.  Went good, no problem.  I also subscribe to Netflix.  Downloaded the Kindle app for that and it seems to work fine.  Just so you know, if you buy an app via your PC to install later on the Kindle, it will not show up in the cloud immediately.  Be patient, it will get there.  Would be nice if Kindle had Flash Player, but I knew ahead of time that was not the case.  Not the fault of Amazon/Kindle, Adobe decided that they would no longer support Flash on the Android platform.  Next, I found a link to the Open Library project (openlibrary.org) at the Amazon site.  This is one of the sites where thousands of ebooks are available to be borrowed at no cost.  This is where I got my first bad surprise.  Some of the older books in the archive are available for download in MOBI or unprotected PDF or unprotected ePub formats.  Some also have the \\""Send To Kindle\\"" option, which Amazon may or may not charge a fee for.  EVERY ONE of the more modern books I was interested in had only 3 reading options.  The first was a format that is delivered to your browser in real time.  You cannot download that format to read later off-line.  The two formats that can be downloaded for later reading are protected PDF and protected ePub.  These formats (at least through Open Library) must be managed via Adobe Digital Editions which Kindle does not support.  So yeah, there are lots of books at Open Library that I was interested in but I cannot read them on my Kindle.  Also linked from Amazon, is Many Books (manybooks.net).  Most (all?) of their content is Kindle compatible, but Idid not see anything there I was really interested in.  There are probably other options out there, the web is a big place.  I have not had a chance to look yet, but was disappointed in Many Books and Open Library.<br /><br />Update - April 1<br /><br />OK, so I may have jumped the gun a bit --- Sorry.  Content that is protected by Adobe DRM cannot be opened by the Kindle reader but I think there is a work around.  According to the Adobe website their DRM software, Adobe Digital Editions, will work with the Aldiko reader app.  Aldiko can be loaded onto the Kindle.  The Aldiko app is in the Amazon app store in two versions.  The free version is dumbed down and ad supported.  The premium version is only $2.99 and has advanced features and no ads.  I am pretty busy right now so I cannot play around with this to check it out.  Will update this post again when I get a chance to try it out.","0.133","0.782","0.085"

After several conversations with the very nice people at Amazon support, I exchanged my device.  But the second is not significantly better.

I have to say, I might have to start stealing his Fire from time to time.<br /><br />It's smaller than I'm used to (7\\"" vs. 10\\"") and lighter by far.  The interface is easy to negotiate (a little too easy for my liking with the carousel, but my husband is good with it), and the whole device is much more snappy than I expected.  I'm really impressed with the video streaming!  The resolution is much better than I thought, and it streamed just like my more costly tablet without any problems or weird buffering.<br /><br />That said, I don't like it much for reading.  I much prefer E-ink to the backlit screen, which is the case with my Xoom, too.

I've always loved the Kindle family and have believed their products were top-notch, however this is sadly not the case with the Fire HD. I've had it for about a week and I've had to factory reset it about four times. It will randomly tell me an \\""unknown error had occurred\\"" and I have to uninstall all my apps and books and re-install them. That's if I'm lucky and I can get it to connect to the wifi.  The date/time randomly reset to 23:47 on January 1, 2000, which makes it impossible to connect to the Amazon Appstore, however the device won't let me change the date/time. This is all on top of the ads that pervade the system that apparently we have to pay extra to opt out of...what were you thinking Amazon? A faulty device, with software that you clearly released too early without working out all the bugs AND you want me to pay you extra to not see third party ads?

"B0083PWAPW","5","6","6","I loved my Kindle right out of the box. It works for me because I'm no tech-geek who knows anything better. What you see onscreen displayed here on Amazon, is what you get. Have had it a week now and I have fallen in love with it. The price, you can't beat it (16 gb). My first book ordered was \\""Faith In the Valley\\"" by Iyanla Vanzant. Powerful Keeper.<br /><br />The sound is awesome and the usb cord that came with it is all I needed to keep powered up. When not in use I just connect it to my computer. If you don't have a computer I suggest that you purchase the adapter or you can buy one at Walmart for the same price of $19.99 or at a reduced amount of $9.98 when you order the KFHD. If you don't you will have to pay the full price.<br /><br />Also I would suggest getting the case for it. I purchased the \\""Fintie\\"" brand Leopard case after I ordered. Can't wait for it to arrive. They have a great collection here for the 7 inch HD.<br /><br />I'm 60 years old, if I can understand how to use it right out the box, belive me you can too. Get to know it first and away you'll go.

"B0083PWAPW","5","137","121","I own and have previously used a regular Kindle for reading, which I preferred using over traditional paperbacks. The Fire HD, remarkably, is even BETTER to read from - which came as a surprise to me, since I assumed it would not match the reading experience of the regular Kindle. I find the bright screen of the Fire HD to be marvelous to read from. I experience no glare, and can read for prolonged periods of time with no issues whatsoever. The screen can be read in any lighting condition, since it's so bright. For some people, it will be a tad TOO bright, but I believe you can adjust this in the settings.<br /><br />What I really love about the Fire HD's reading interface is how it makes me a BETTER reader. How? A number of ways. First of all, I love the feature that lets me highlight passages that I like by simply running my finger over them, making them easy to revisit at a later time. I used to enjoy highlighting passages in traditional books, but I was generally too involved in my book to get up and go look for a pen - so I skipped it. Additionally, one of the Fire's functions conveniently stores all highlighted areas, so you can easily go back to your favorite parts (as well as having a simpler \\""bookmark\\"" feature). You can even \\""share\\"" the passages you like on social networks, if you're into that sort of thing. All of these things were possible with the regular Kindle e-reader, but with this tablet, they're 100x easier (thanks to an intuitive, responsive touch interface), and I actually find myself USING the features (all the time).<br /><br />The Fire HD also retains the ability to change the size of the font you're reading, quickly and easily. Again, this is something that the previous Kindle could do, but I find it much more intuitive with the touch controls. Once you get used to the way the device works (which doesn't take long), everything becomes second nature.<br /><br />What else? Page turns are smooth and seamless (something the original Fire stuttered on). Turning pages is incredibly slick - you don't even get that brief \\""black flash\\"" that the regular Kindle performs to refresh its pixels. In fact, you can even PARTIALLY turn the pages, just like in a real book! You turn pages with a quick swipe of the thumb. But if you keep your thumb on the screen/page, you can gently begin to turn the page forward/backward, and hold it where you want. Very useful, if you quickly want to go back to the last sentence or two you read on the previous page, or peek ahead to see if you're near the end of the chapter.<br /><br />I also find that I love having color in my Kindle. Although reading is primarily a black and white affair, it's great to have color when you're perusing the covers of the books in your library, as well as when you're seeing the occasional picture. I generally read novels, but I've perused comics and picture books, and the Fire HD delivers in stunning fashion.<br /><br />Speaking of that color screen (and it should be mentioned that cramming 720p resolution into a 7\\"" screen is a technological marvel), video is also outstanding (something that I also couldn't do on my previous Kindle). It's really fun to read for a bit in bed, and then catch a quick episode of \\""Parks and Rec\\"" on the Netflix app. It doesn't look quite as sharp as it does on my 40\\"" 1080p Samsung (understandable), but it looks darned good, and I feel like it might get even better with downloaded movies (as opposed to streaming). I watched a trailer for a Batman movie on the demo unit at Staples, and it was incredible- it's what sealed the deal for me. The sound on the Fire HD is everything it's been hyped to be, coming through crisp and loud. I also like the placement of the speakers, because if you hold the tablet with both hands, it bounces off of your palms and comes right back at you (although you can still hear it just fine, no matter how you hold it).<br /><br />The Fire HD has some faults - the charging time is painfully slow with the included USB charger, the power button is ridiculously hard to find, and the surface of the back is a bit too slippery. But these flaws are easy to overlook, considering all that I get in return from my Fire HD. It truly makes me look forward to reading every night, and it's a lot of fun to build and browse my digital library (I'm currently collecting Newberry Medal winners - and the ease with which I can quickly download these should also be commended).

"B0051VVOB2","4","0","0","I have thoroughly enjoyed my Kindle Fire since it arrived in Nov. It has taken over a ton of the duties my Android phone once had to do. I am very happy with it.  The screen size is perfect and it is light enough to be easy to use for an extended amount of time.   The Fire appstore does not have as many applications on it as the Google market.  I have found that a lot of the apps not yet on the amazon appstore work completely fine.  Wish the app venders would catch up and get their apps loaded onto the appstore. So many of them work perfectly on the Fire.    The media infrastructure was the killer-app for me. I have wanted a highly mobile device that I could watch Netflix, Amazon Videos, and my own personal media server media on. I hated having to pull out the laptop to do this.  Now I can access all three from this one tablet. Superb. Amazon Video on the Fire is oustanding quality.  Netflix is very good too, though Amazon obviously knew how to get the most out of the Fire for their own purposes.   I use my Kindle Fire for everything except my primary reading device.  I still prefer the e-ink Kindle Reader for my voluminous book reading. Loving all my Kindles.  The only issue I have seen with my Fire is that the audio appears to be messed up when plugged into a external sound system.  It has a ferocious hiss that may require me to contact customer service to fix it. Problem doesn't arise when listening through the internal speakers.  Otherwise I am very happy with the Fire. Great price, great function.  Couldn't be happier.","0.164","0.736","0.1"

The problem with this new KFHD is that it is very limited to the apps you can download.  Kindle has made it impossible to download Google apps,that is of course if you decide not to Root the KFHD.  The other issue I have is that Flash is not made part of the KFHD and therefore you cannot watch many videos, including Youtube. Forget about the camera, you can download a camera app but the quality of pics taken is very very poor.  Finally, why not include 3G so the user does not have to rely on searching for WIFI hot spots in order to take advantage of the full value of the KFHD....poor thinking on the part of the developers.","0.064","0.87","0.066"

"B0051VVOB2","5","5","4","The Kindle Fire is almost wonderful. Incredible graphics, great interface, perfect size and almost what I expected. I bought it because I wanted a color reader that I could use to read while listening to music. What I got wasn't quite that. Don't get me wrong. I do love it, especially the price, but it does have limitations.  I'm giving the device 5 stars. It really is great - but be aware of its limitations. The marketing descriptions would not get 5 stars for truth in advertising.  My complaint is about the \\""Cloud\\"" description on the selling page. Amazon may not have meant to mislead the reader, but the \\""Unlimited Cloud\\"" only stores Amazon purchased music, etc. I have a vast music collection, especially vinyl and 78s which I digitized for my personal use. And when I mean vast, I mean over 500 albums, probably 300 or more 45s, and about 200 78s, some of which are very rare and should not be handled. Ever. (And no, I had no plans to store all that in the \\""Cloud\\"". I have a Green Drive for that.)  The \\""Cloud\\"" will not store much non-Amazon music, though the device will store some of it; but, I do not want to fill up the device with music that the \\""Cloud\\"" won't accept. The KF has no more space than my iPhone, so I know that I can't really put any music on it. I had hoped for a machine on which I could read and listen to part of my music collection, but the Kindle Fire isn't it (and I'm not going to pay $20 a month for limited \\""Cloud\\"" space of non Amazon items.)  So, it is not a tablet. Be aware of that when you purchase it and choose your apps wisely. You've only got about 6 gigs of actual storage on the device.  But, as a reader, it is wonderful and that is the primary reason I purchased it. I just wasn't happy with the \\""Unlimited Cloud\\"" marketing phraseology. It's misleading.  Oh, I have the Netflix app. The movie quality is superb.  Overall, I'm happy. I just wish the marketing had been clearer about the \\""Cloud\\"".","0.129","0.783","0.088"

Also no mouse or mouse-like area so you cant move the cursor easily when entering text. And given the touch screen only method of entry and selection, it's extremely frustrating that i cant copy text and paste it in to some other areas like email address areas.  The inability to watch anything requiring flash media player means no youtube and many other embedded videos.  Also i knew this was not an ipad whan i ordered it bought thought that doubletwist or other players would be available. That hasnt worked out so far tho ive only been trying for the last week.  My audible books are sync'd and that's nice.  i purchased a text editor/office-type integrated package, but there's no dictionary as part of that software or preinstalled on the kindle. so spell checking doesnt work. u have to buy every little add-on that u might take 4 granted and depend on to do ur normal tasks.  so the total cost will b much higher than the 199$.","0.072","0.825","0.104"

"B00BWYQ9YE","5","0","0","Pros: Great Display, Great sound for tablet, Great size (not too big to be difficult to carry but easy to read on the device), Great price for the hardware you get (especially when ordered on Cyber Monday), runs videos and Netflix great and has crystal clear display. Amazon apps work great.<br /><br />Cons: As an Android phone user, It took a while to get use to Amazon carousel.  I would also prefer to have designated home and back buttons.  Volume switch also took a bit getting use to based on its placement.  Only apps from amazon store work seemlessly, although others will usually play with work arounds (ie, sideloading apps).  Although there are some you tube apps on the amazon app store they are not the official app from google and sometimes miss on searching for desired video. I prefer the full android experience compare to Amazon carousel but that is not a knock on the device, and that is why I give the device a 5 star rating.<br /><br />  I ordered this for my wife as a cyber Monday special.  Although she is apple Iphone user she has been using kindles for years to read her books.  That is why I went with the Fire HDX.  Everything transferred easily to her new device.  She did have to learn the carousel, but the tablet works exactly as we had anticipated.  We knew all that other stuff going in.  This review is not to argue between Apple and Amazon.  The HDX 7&#34; works like it should and does exactly what we expected it would do.  We have had no problems.

"B0051VVOB2","5","2","2","Before purchasing the Kindle Fire, I had been using a Samsung Galaxy Tab. I bought my wife the Kindle Fire for her birthday and I was very impressed with its usefulness and utility. Aside from the fact that the Fire does not take photos, I am easily able to surf the web and use it as a replacement for my tab device. The electronic books are impossible to put down once you start reading them. There is something about the page format that is compelling to the reader and encourages you to keep reading. I am not certain why this is. You will have to be careful to turn the device off completely when not in use; otherwise, the batteries will run down quickly. Unlike my wife's original Kindle, this device does not have network access and can only be used with wi-fi. This trait is fine when you have easy access to wi-fi -- but, not so good if you are using it in a more remote location. I can also say that, when opening up web pages in the browser, the font is very small and can sometimes be difficult for older eyes to read. Enlarging the font or the page is possible, but then the page does not comfortably fit onto the screen. Overall, this is an excellent device and suits my needs perfectly.","0.107","0.814","0.08"

While Santa hasn't delivered these yet, my initial impression is that Amazon has a lot of kinks to work out.  Pros: Brilliant color, quick access to primary functions that are very user friendly (books, video, music, etc). Whispersync is great as I hate having to manually sync my phone to my computer.  Cons: While a password can be required to unlock the Fire, there's no password required to make purchases through the tablet. That means kids can buy apps, movies, books and the like directly from your account without your knowledge or approval.   You know how you can buy DVDs and Blu Rays with a digital copy for a few dollars more? Yeah, you can't view those digital copies on your Fire. Fire only supports 2 file types and neither are defaults on those digital copies. So you have to either buy converter software and spend a lot of time converting those movies, or buy digital versions directly from Amazon which means you can't watch the movie anyplace else unless you can hook up your computer to your TV. If you choose to convert your movies they must be manually moved to the Fire (you'll need to buy a micro USB cable and hook up to your computer - Whispersync won't help you here), then those videos won't be in the video tab, they'll be in the Gallery which is a pain to find, and the videos won't be labeled.

Not a hitch. I have the Netflix app on my Fire but I haven't tried it yet. I have downloaded music and that works great. If your not aware, music purchased off Amazon will not count against you cloud capacity. Basically their saying you have unlimited capacity for music! Awesome.<br /><br />I had to download a calendar program for the Fire and I choose Fliq Calendar which seems to be just like the calendar I have on my Android phone. It was free. Unfortunately I can not sync them without purchasing a $40 program.<br /><br />Of course the real purpose of the Fire is to read books and it functions perfectly at that. I haven't subscribed to any magazines yet so I really can't comment on the color, however if the movies are any indication, I'm sure they will be awesome.<br /><br />Some folks have complained about the fact that the on/off button gets turned off accidentally because of its placement. Here is a clue for you folks, TURN THE KINDLE FIRE UPSIDE DOWN SO THAT THE SCREEN ROTATES 180 DEGREES AND THE ON/OFF SWITCH IS NOW AT THE TOP OF THE FIRE! Wow, that was tough to figure out!<br /><br />Really, for $199 you can not beat this thing. My daughters boyfriend had his new Nook Tablet over and in comparing the two, I'd say hands down the Fire is a better deal.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I ordered this and got it the next day! The next day during Christmas season. That was incredible.<br /><br />Update 10/29/2013. OK, so now it has been almost two years since I purchased my Kindle Fire and it is still running just as good as when I first purchased it! Not a single problem has occurred! Now, since my last review, I have uploaded about 5000 songs to my Kindle Cloud and have watched hundreds of movies both from Prime and from Netflix. I've read dozens of books (both free and purchased). Never an issue! How often do I use my Kindle? EVERY NIGHT! So now that the new Fire's are out, I might purchase and upgrade!","0.127","0.758","0.116"

"B0051VVOB2","5","1","1","The Kindle Fire is no monster-storage powerhouse, but it functions just as it is described and I have loved it as an e-book reader, as a web browser/media device, and as a place to use apps.   The aforementioned order is in line with its strengths with E-book reader being the strongest selling point followed by being a web browser and an app device.   The Fire does most things correctly. The E-reader is usable and fast without that blasted blinking that happens with the regular Kindles. It works very smooth for reading novels. The web browsing and Email are very well designed for the device and have a nice feature that increases speed. Amazon allows the Kindle to process some back-end data on its servers (the cloud) which helps speed up Internet access even when you don't have the best connection. Apps are only as good as the developers. Angry Birds runs perfectly, as well as those made from other well known phone app developers. An issue that has arisen is that since there are less apps (as of the moment) than on regular phone app stores the crappy ones stand out more. There are also less apps in general which will turn some people off.   The biggest flaw is the memory situation. ~6.5 gigs of usable space is a deterrent to many (considering there is no micro SD slot). This is not that bad if you mainly want the device for books and internet as I do. I will put choice songs or albums on the device, but I have never been much for watching movies on the go. I use the device as a way to pick it up for a quick read and then get back to work (at which point I can use it to check email, etc.) The battery only lasts for about 8 hours of use, but that is expected for a tablet and is not a deterrent to use if you are someone who is at home or at the office for long spans of time.   Overall, this device is meant to be bought for reading books and web browsing smoothly and accurately and with all the other features as cool/quality perks. (IMO)","0.114","0.828","0.057"

"B0051VVOB2","5","2","2","Purchased it for my wife for Xmas after extensive research, so far have been very pleased. Does exactly what it's designed for. For the Ipad lovers, you can have your camera and your 3g connection and the device so big you look ridiculous taking pictures or videos. We can hold this in one hand, touch screen is vivid and responsive. Complaints about the power button are silly, just turn it over. Fairly intuitive, we navigated through most everything without any operator's guide. The power of Amazon gives great potential going forward for content and growth. I understand a software update is imminent to address some concerns about the home page, I don't see a problem. My 8 year old played games and watched a movie we downloaded, only took several minutes on my home wireless network, faster than my download on itunes. Battery life seems fine, and the concern re: limited apps is unwarranted, most all the most popular apps are available and who needs to (or actually does)scroll and search through 1/2 million apps avail for the Ipad. All for a package price less than half the competitors.  Well done Amazon.","0.167","0.799","0.034"

"B0051VVOB2","5","1","1","With 18,000+ reviews of the Fire online already, it seems almost superfluous to add another.  But here's one for any of you who have a friend or relative who is a bit computer-phobic: The Fire could be the answer!<br /><br />We have tried for YEARS to get my 89-year-old mother-in-law to master some form of computing.  We've tried with a Mac, and with a laptop.  No matter what we tried, she was intimidated, and it went nowhere.<br /><br />Then I got a Fire.  I already had an earlier Kindle, and I have to say, from my own perspective, I liked that but I LOVE the Fire.  I use it every day.  But as we experimented with the tap-click approach of a stylus, we thought... Hmmm... Maybe THIS would be the solution.<br /><br />So we got another one.  We presented it to MIL.  And within a few hours she was giggling like a schoolgirl as she figured out how to master one technique after another.  She asked if she could use it to look up stock quotes -- yep, we can do that.  Now she knows exactly how to find her quotes at the end of the day.  She can finally read e-mail messages, AND send them, AND look at pictures as attachments.  We got her a Dominoes app, and she's figured out how to work that.<br /><br />It's not a replacement for a computer, but for her, it does everything she needs.  It's more \\""intuitive\\"" than a tablet (tried one, didn't like it).  It responds well despite occasional tremors in her hands.  She likes the fact that if she wants to get out of something, she doesn't have to do anything complicated - just hit the \\""home\\"" button.<br /><br />We really had been on the point of giving up ever dragging MIL into the \\""computer\\"" age.  So, thanks, Amazon, for giving a lovely, active 89-year-old lady a chance to experience a new dimension in the electronic age!<br /><br />(Did I mention I love it too???)","0.176","0.792","0.033"

Note that Netflix streaming works great as well.<br />Fast, Everything it does is fast...my old Acer 510 seems unbearably slow now.<br />Front facing camera is the only one that makes sense to me, that it doesn't have a rear camera is no loss...my phone, iPod, and digital camera makes for enough of the things...who needs another?<br /><br />The Bad<br />Heavy, i say this as i'm accustomed to the weight of my Kindle Touch for reading books, the primary reason i own any Kindle device. The Fire HD feels like it's made from lead compared to the feather weight of the Touch...this will not replace my Kindle Touch as my primary reading device. Something you may want to consider if you're trying to justify purchasing this by selling or not needing a standard Kindle reader.<br /><br />Size, I claimed this was great for movies in the 'good' column above, and it is, but as i planned to use the device primarily for reading the screen size (7') and for internet browsing, it's just too small for internet browsing without using my fairly strong reading glasses...perhaps this is only a problem for middle aged folks like myself who need reading glasses, but it doesn't compare to browsing at home on my desktop. For reading books the font size is easily changed to make it easier on my eyes....if like me you need those reading glasses you would be better served with the 8.9\\"" model, as money was an issue for me i had to settle for the 7\\"" model.<br />Some advice if you'll take it...pay for the 32 gig version in whatever size you buy, the cloud is fine, but unless you have an LTE version you'll wish you had the extra storage. 16 gigs just isn't enough for the way people use these devices.<br />I had a few issues with the device locking up, removing some of the older apps solved this for me...i suppose apps written for cell phones or older tablets can cause issues, or so it seemed to me.he extra storage. 16 gigs just isn't enough for the way people use these devices.<br />I had a few issues with the device locking up, removing some of the older apps solved this for me...i suppose apps written for cell phones or older tablets can cause issues, or so it seemed to me.","0.098","0.884","0.018"

"B00BWYQ9YE","5","2","2","I've wanted a tablet for a while. I've also wanted to upgrade my Kindle Touch, which seemed very slow to me, response-wise. With iPad being pricey the kindle seemed like a natural choice. I considered getting the paperwhite, but thought a little extra would get me a lot more. I underestimated myself.<br /><br />As an e-reader this kindle does what you expect and more. I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.<br /><br />I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.<br /><br />There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.<br /><br />The web browser is great. Nothing mind blowing, but I didn't buy this to surf the web. The ease of navigation in the Amazon store (be it through the Amazon app or the Bookstore app) is supreme. Books and other items can easily be bought and books download immediately.<br /><br />I can't express my love for this tablet enough. It is definitely one of my favorite purchases in a long time.

My only real complaint is that the battery only lasts maybe three days if I'm just reading, say 2-3 hours a day, but I have to charge it daily if I get on the internet with it. Buyer beware, you can't just buy the Kindle Fire. You have to spend another $20ish on a screen protector like for a smart phone, plus a wall adapter charger or you're stuck with charging on a computer with a USB.

"B0051VVOB2","2","8","4","I unexpectedly received a Kindle Fire for Christmas! After several days of playing with it, there are four serious reservations I have:  1) It's slow, slow, slow. You never know if you pushed/did/whatever the right thing, because the response time is such an abomination.  2) market.android.com stuff, which is for Android devices, don't work on the Kindle Fire. Real BUMMER. I expected Android stuff to work.  3) Even a lot of Amazon's downloads get a \\""red X\\"" next to \\""Tom's Kindle\\"", indicating that a lot of stuff they're even offering doesn't work on my Kindle.  4) Their newsreader, Pulse, displays the first para or two of an article and then has a button to \\""go to original article\\"" for continued reading. Doesn't work, Period. You would think even their newsreader would work, wouldn't you? Of course, the NBC news widget at market.android.com won't download/install on this stupid Fire either, since it's not from Amazon.  I'm really disappointed. Lack of software. Lack of responsiveness. Great hardware, I suppose, but what can you do with it. They're going to have to go a long way to make this thing usable.","0.03","0.874","0.097"

"B00BWYRF7E","5","2","2","I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; with 32GB as a replacement for my old Kindle, which had made its way into my son's bedroom, never to reappear (he is an avid reader). I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks:<br />1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)<br /><br />2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.<br /><br />3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.<br /><br />Now for the pros:<br />1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do<br />2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire<br />3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval<br />4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.<br /><br />Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!<br /><br />I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking to read books and also watch movies or tv, play a few games, and run a few apps, then the Kindle Fire is an excellent choice.ead books and also watch movies or tv, play a few games, and run a few apps, then the Kindle Fire is an excellent choice.","0.129","0.82","0.051"
"B0051VVOB2","5","0","0","I've used both the iPad and the Fire.  In my opinion, the Fire is not a direct competitor to the iPad.  The Fire lets me do what I want quickly and easily.  Great apps, email, browsing are all easily done.  I have read comments from some so-called \\""usability\\"" experts complaining about the size of the touch screen and fat fingering input.  Well, it's a 7 inch screen.  Smaller than the iPad...it will be more compact.  I wonder what qualifies one as a uasbility expert, anyway?<br /><br />That being said, the device won't please everyone.  If you are looking for a computer replacement, you will be disappointed.  So far, my books, magazines, movies, music and apps run well.  It has exceeded expectations.  Measure the device against intended use, and not wishful thinking.<br /><br />EDIT:  I want to make sure that I include my hands on experience with the Fire, as many of the negative reviews fail to do so.  I've owned Kindles in one form or another since version one.  This is a different machine altogether.  I use it every day for reading, videos, email, work and applications (mostly games).  I have not had any significant interface issues.  Yes, there are times that you need to press more than once on the touch screen.  But I've had this issue with other touch screen devices, and given some experience you learn how to touch the screen (firm press for about 2 seconds) to get it to work.  Browsing is more than adequate.  Is it comparable to my desktop computer?  No.  But I don't expect it to be.  However, it is sufficient to let me browse what I want, where I want, and when I want.  It is fast enough, and I have not had any issues with speed that I consider out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Now, for the button issues.  First, I am happy there is no volume button on the outside of the unit.  One less thing to hit and adjust while holding the Fire.  It is a simple screen touch to bring the volume up.  As for the power button, I've never hit it accidentally.  I don't know why this is an issue for some.  I handle my Fire in a case, and outside the case as well, and I have never turned off the Fire accidentally.<br /><br />The app store has all that I want.  I have side-loaded a few apps that I use on my Android phone to the Fire that aren't in the Kindle App store (Yahoo Fantasy Football, for example).  You can do that by saving the executable file to your computer and loading to the Fire.  There are instructions all over the net to do it. However, I find the selection of apps to be sufficient, and I have no issues with the store.  I understand Amazon's desire to limit the number of apps available and to have some control over their ecosystem.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic product for me.  So much so that I'm giving my iPad 2 to my son.  Just don't need it anymore.<br /><br />PS...typed on my Fire.this is an issue for some.

"B0051VVOB2","4","3","2","My college-aged daughter loves it, uses it for both reading and internet.  Battery life is very good, does movies, FB etc.  Very responsive. IMO, all these tablets/iPads etc. are for casual / social activity.  Don't expect to do serious typing like on a laptop, and who wants to plug in a separate keyboard.  Hunt and peck on a virtual keyboard is a pain for me (though it's as easy as any other tablet). Some have complained that there is no volume control 'button'.  To me this is an asset.  My 'nandroid' (Nook Color running Android OS) has volume button and I keep hitting it while holding the tablet.  I;d prefer having it as a software control.  I do wish there was an way to print from these devices directly (none are really set up for it).  And I really think a camera should have been part of it.  Not because I'd use the camera all that much, but capturing those barcodes/boxes to make 'shopping' easier should have been a no-brainer for Amazon since internet sales is the real driving force for Amazon's entry.  Steve Jobs may have thought the 7\\"" was too big to compete against Smartphones and too small to compete with the larger iPad, but most people who have used these love the extra 'portability' and the ability to show off their images at a decent size.  Just stick the Fire in your cargo pants and off you go!  Interestingly, now that Jobs is gone and Amazon has sold a million of them every week for over a month, Apple has hinted they'll come out with one after all... around summertime.

Was so disappointed that had to purchase the standard Kindle reader again. That works fine. Contacted customer service to see if they would work through a return of this terrible product and they are stead fast on buyer beware beyond 30 days. They will take a return and say you can get a tradein credit up to 80%, but it could be 20%. You just have to send it in and trust they would do the right thing. Based on experience with them, I would not trust them. We have purchased thousands of dollars of e-books through the years from Amazon for the Kindle and to be treated like this is terrible. I would highly recomend going to a place like Barnes & Noble where you can see and touch and use the product and go into the store if you have a problem.

We also took it on our trip to Virginia beach- the flight was 3 1/2 hours; but I loaded a few hours worth of StarTrek and Fringe shows and those few hours went so fast! Also used it in the hotel with the pre-loaded shows. (Hotel wifi sucks!) Very happy with it. A calculator app would be nice though, and the Browser experience could use work.

Will be a nice tool or kids for fun but no serious work, or for older Indiviuals it would be easy to use.","0.127","0.746","0.127"
"B0051VVOB2","5","3","2","Amazon hits a home run. The Kindle Fire has got to be one of the best values out there  . I was skeptical when my wife said she wanted the Fire for Christmas {she opened it immediately} that Amazon could come through for that amount of money, but they sure did. My wife has not put it down since it arrived, she let's me use it occasionally and even I can get around on it. I'm not sure why some of the tech experts keep trying to compare it to the ipad, it is not in that catagory and wasn't meant to be. The few complaints that I have read about seem to be fairly minor, we haven't felt that those are real problems: the volume control, the on/off switch. If I can figure out these minor things then anybody should be able to. This is one of those devices that does exactly what it was designed to do at a very reasonable price.

"B0051VVOB2","4","7","3","I will be the first to admit that I am a longtime Apple lover. I have had many generations of iPods, recently got my MacBook and my iPhone. Not to mention I have been lusting after the iPad since its introduction. I could not bring myself nor convince my husband to pay the steep price of $499 for a tablet. Enter the Kindle Fire. I received it as a Christmas gift and I instantly fell in love. Sure it doesn't have video or camera capability, but with all the smartphone technology these days is that really necessary for a tablet ? Not in my humble opinion. I'm a big reader and like to read multiple books at the same time - this works beautifully for that purpose. We went to the beach this past weekend for New Years and I read two books on the Kindle Fire this weekend. Absolutely wonderful !!! And it sure beats carrying around a stack of books that I may not get to thats for sure. Another great benefit of the Kindle vs the iPad is the HUGE selection on eBooks in the Kindle store. The majority of the times the prices in the Kindle store are competitive to the iBook store, if not cheaper sometimes.<br /><br />The battery life is impressive. I can go a few days without charging it, as long as I keep my activity low key like reading or checking email. Now playing angry birds for hours in a row like my husband did on New Years will drain the battery, so be warned :) !<br /><br />Another benefit is the apps are a lot cheaper in the Kindle store than they are in the iTunes App store. Plants vs Zombies will run you 4.99 in the iTunes store compared to $1.49 in the Kindle Store - one of many example.<br /><br />As far as the actual Kindle itself, its the size of a paperback novel so not too heavy. Its very simple to use, you can easily go back and forth between applications, books and the web. Email and web browsing are simple to use. The touch screen technology is great, with minor delays sometimes but usually not.<br /><br />If you are looking for a tablet thats not as steep as the iPad, dont necessarily need 3G, video or camera capability - this is the tablet for you. Highly recommended !deo or camera capability - this is the tablet for you. Highly recommended !","0.184","0.778","0.039"

"B0051VVOB2","5","9","5","I was originally torn between the new Nook color and the Kindle Fire. As we have one Nook already in the house I wasn't sure I wanted another one. As Christmas drew near and the decision to choose my next e-reader weighed on my mind - I opted for the Kindle Fire, despite the negative criticism it has received and am very glad I did.   After reviewing the product and using it now for a week - I can say with confidence that the Kindle Fire has everything to make even the most skeptical consumer happy. I was just such a consumer and was almost mislead by the negative press. However, being an independent free thinker I chose the Amazon product because I love Amazon and consider myself an Amazon Nut! I The negative complaints about Kindle Fire are not justified in todays technologically advanced society. The touch screen volume control almost steered me toward the Nook --but truly has not been an issue at all as the touch screen volume control is conveniently located and that was a serius concern for me. I like the idea of a physical volume control on the side of Nook, but honestly I love the Fire so much it hasn't even had any impact on my use at all. The lack of external audio and video output, well lets face it, its an e-reader not a television, but I will say that I have indeed watched movies already on the Fire and love that feature, but I can access the same content through my computer, which can hook up to my TV, my cell phone and or my Nintendo Wii -- so why would I need to hook up my Kindle Fire to my TV? I don't know --seems like a silly, unnecessary additional expense if you ask me. The picture on the screen is amazing. The touch screen has sufficient sensors despite the negative reviews, I have had zero issues with the touchscreen --it works perfect. The security updates seem to be sufficient and password protection is available and should be used. The brightnss level is not an issue as i saw someme complaints about being too bright at night in bed, well if it is too bright even on its loewest setting then change the background from white to black - simple fix! The battery complaint had me truly worried, because a long lasting battery is necessary with such an item --but I keep my brightness turned down pretty low and I have used it for 3-4 hours straight playing games, downloading apps, watching movies, reading emails, and of course reading books and my battery has never drained itself. So I have no complaints with the battery life or brightness of the device. The Kindle Fire is so awesome I just love it.  In a nutshell --all the negative criticism in the weeks before Christmas had me worried, but I stuck with Amazons reputation for greatness and made that my single Christmas request this year. I was not and am not disappointed in the least. In fact most of the criticisms I read about don't hold water. The security issues \\""YES\\"" were critical, I agree, but they have been addressed, so if yu are considering the KINDLE FIRE I say GO for IT! I was very skeptical, but trusted the Amazon reputation and I have not been disappointed in the least. As a household with both a Nook Color and now a Kindle Fire I can honestly say I would choose the Kindle Fire again tomorrow over any other e-reader out there!  Thank you Amazon. What a great product!","0.216","0.679","0.105"

But the positives outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Many reviewers have expressed pros and cons in prior reviews, so I won't go through this in detail.  I will, however, tell you that, once I fully charged the unit, operating it was easy.  I had no trouble setting up all email accounts for me and my spouse.  It is equally easy to find, download and play games.  I love how easy it is to navigate through the screens.  Watching Netflix movies is easy and clear, but I wish the volume would go a bit louder.  It's hard to hear through the unit's speaker when I'm outdoors.  There is also a lot of glare off the glass.  Indoors in a quiet house, no problem.  The only other negative is that I sometimes have to tap the screen multiple times...or with greater force, to get the Fire to recognize my request.  That's a bit annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought it.  It serves my purpose so far, though I'd eventually like to get a 10\\"" tablet, too.  But for now, this works for me.","0.135","0.788","0.078"

Presently I have a problem with it starting. it is not a daily problem but every few days when i turn on my Kindle it reboots itself for some reason. Also, I do not live in the US. I have shopped in Amazon for many years & never had a problem using my card but Kindle will not accept any card not issued in the US for one click shopping on their device. I do not understand why Amazon can accept it but Kindle which is an Amazon product, WILL not. I can not download FREE apps without a US credit card. This makes no sense to me. If it's free & I have obviously bought the product why do I need a card to download a free app? I can't  even download FREE magazines because my Kindle is not supported outside the US. Amazon needs to let buyers be aware that if you do not have a US card or you're not located in the US then what you can purchase for FREE (?!?!?!?!?! - go figure) is limited.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother to recommend this product to anyone.

"B00BWYQ9YE","5","1","1","I have an &#34;original&#34; Kindle that is still in good working order, but I decided to order an upgrade.  I read many negative reviews about the Fire HDX 7&#34;, so it took me a while to decide if I wanted a Kindle or some other tablet (namely, an iPad).  Let me say that I've had my new Kindle for 2 days now, and I absolutely love it.  The display is fantastic; looks better than my HDTV!  I was kind of concerned about set up and transferring my books from one Kindle to another, but all I did was log on to my Amazon account and go to &#34;manage my kindle.&#34;  There is a picture of a cloud, a picture of my Kindle Fire HDX, and a picture of my original Kindle, and every book I currently have downloaded is listed underneath.  All I had to do was click on a book and choose whether or not I wanted to download it to my new Kindle.  Simple.  Until, of course, I went under the &#34;books&#34; section on my HDX and found I could access the Cloud from there.  Simpler yet!  Of course, everything looks totally different from my old Kindle, and I'm not sure I'm in love with the carousel.  (Could be I'm just not used to it).  I've had no problem downloading apps, books, and movies.  I was a bit confused about accessing a movie I rented from Amazon instant video, so I used the Mayday button and was connected to a live person (who I could see on the screen) in about 5 seconds (no lie).  He talked and &#34;walked&#34; me through the process and I was watching a movie within 3 minutes!  I have accessed the user's guide a few times, but Mayday is great if you're in a hurry or really confused by something.  I've never had an issue with Amazon's customer service, and Mayday put the icing on my cake!  In summary: the video quality and sound are excellent, the Fire HDX is light (MUCH lighter than my husband's 1st generation Fire) and easy/comfortable to hold, and overall its very user friendly.  The camera only takes pictures from the front, but I didn't buy this for photos, so that's not an issue for me.  I also bought the leather origami case and have no problems with it.  I've used it in both portrait and landscape settings and it seems sturdy but non-obtrusive.","0.109","0.809","0.082"

"B0083Q04IQ","5","2251","2062","I just received my kindle fire today.  I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite.  I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading.  I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks.  It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info.  The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this.  The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time.  I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace)  in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, \\""11/22/63\\"".<br /><br />I also tested out the text to speech.  It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard.  It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version.  I am very, very pleased with it.<br /><br />It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.<br /><br />If you are worried about the free offers, don't be.  I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television.  The offers only show on the startup, no big deal.  I already took advantage of a $5.00 credit for amazon video.  I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway.  So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.<br /><br />My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements.  I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.  These are books I always wanted to read,but never had the discipline to just read them.  Reading and listening to those books are worth the price of this new gadget, IMO.<br /><br />Way to go, Amazon, for a great product and a great price!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I have an iPad, and the last time I went on vacation, I left it at home and brought only my fire and kindle keyboard.  I didn't miss my iPad at all and this new gen fire is even better.  Seriously, it's that good.or a great product and a great price!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I have an iPad, and the last time I went on vacation, I left it at home and brought only my fire and kindle keyboard.

For one, I actually like the screen size, I like the fact that I can hold it with one hand.  I think Apple should make the ipad smaller.  Let's face it...Apple sells overpriced electronic devices and computers. POINT BLANK! They are overpriced. You are paying for the name people! I do have $600 to spend but why waste money when this sweet little Kindle fire does what I need it to do and more. I love the on screen keyboard and I like that it has a dedicated / button (Yeah, I don't want to have to switch forms to press /, especially since I'm an avid web surfer). I purchased it primarily for reading but the added benefits of all of the above make it irresistable. Oh, Did I mention the price???!!...

"B0051VVOB2","3","8","5","My Fire is my 3rd Kindle. I loved the original, and the 3rd Gen (now called the Keyboard) is as close to perfection as the e-ink style could be. I have now had my Fire for several months, and it is true that I use it nearly daily. Since I read mostly news, magazines, and free current content rather than books, the Pulse app on the Fire is a one step alternative to using Calibre and a cable each day to side load content to the Kindle Keyboard. The sad part is, that nearly everything on the Fire relies on wifi availability at the time you are reading it, including your own 'cloud' library, AND including magazine purchased subscription content from Amazon. Even if I can see the magazine cover on my carousel, if I'm not near a working hotspot, I can't read complete articles in the magazines.  I have a hotspot on my cell phone, (Verizon) and whenever I am away from wifi, (ie at work, or sitting on a beach or in a nice park somewhere..) I attempt to use the Hotspot. I always get a very strong connection phone to kindle, but rarely does this result in a web page actually opening on the kindle. At the same location I am able to browse the web with the phone so it is evident the signal is there. So, since Amazon has chosen to withhold the option for internet access...despite the technological availability, I will regretfully be looking at the Apple alternative very soon. It truly saddens me that Amazon came SO CLOSE and yet chose to deprive its loyal customers by holding back on this most important feature.","0.107","0.822","0.071"

"B0051VVOB2","5","2","2","For those considering the Kindle Fire, please do not mistake this with other tablets on the market.  This is first and foremost a content consumer.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that if you wish to consider the Fire, think about what you will use your tablet for.  If you want something to read books, comics, play apps, check your email, watch tv shows or movies, listen to music, then this device will do all of that well if not great.  I got mine the first day the 17th and have been happily using it daily since.  While it does not have features that the iPad has or the Android tablets do, it is also far cheaper than almost all of them.  Negatives would be that the speakers are both on one side, there is no means of downloading unless you are near a wifi hotspot, the memory is only 8gb (6gb that you can utilize), lack of a memory expansion slot and some limitations to the variety of apps.  Now with those negatives, the speaker one isn't a biggie as the sound is good and if you want surround you aren't really using the built ins on any of these devices, rather ear buds or headphones.  The lack of constant contact to the web while not always convenient, isn't all bad in part to the reason for the memory which I will get to, but also becuase I have a smartphone if I need instant connection and I would rather not add another data plan if I can.  Again costs are nicely minimized, but there is always a downside to that kind of thing.  The memory is a tricky thing, because I like being able to store loads of songs, movies and other content on my phone and Zune HD.  Well here, with the integration of the cloud and use of their Prime service, storage isn't as big a deal.  I can keep 6 or 7 720p movies on it that look spectacular, 50 - 100 books, a couple of albums, 20 - 30 apps that I like using, a magazine subscribtion and still have about 1 gb left to spare.  Would I like the extra space, yeah, but do I need it... not really.  Reality is that the extra storage space whilenice is really a crutch and having a limitation, at least to me, makes me only keep things that I really want to use with it.  Again this is not a swiss army knife to solve any problem that arrises, but rather a power screw driver that has an intended purposes with some utility, but again it is designed for a specific use and worrying or griping about what it can't do is missing the forest for the trees.  The last thing about the variety of apps, to me is more of a similar problem to the magazines.  Not all of them that I want are out there yet, but given time, they likely will be.  I guess patience is the key and am willing to not condemn it out of hand for that.  So overall, I am pleased with my Fire.  It incorporates a lot of various activities I like and the price was great to get me to take the plunge.  The size is nice in that is easily hand held and large enough that it does functions my phone can't do due to size limitations, while not being so big it is unwieldy.  I hope this helps others in their consideration.  This is worthwhile tech in my opinion and well worth the money if you are looking for something that can do the things this does and like Amazon as a portal for content consumption.","0.136","0.809","0.055"

"B0051VVOB2","5","3","2","I will start off saying that I have never owned a smart phone, or an iPad or other tablet. I haven't used or bought an e-reader of any kind, so this is my first experience with any of this stuff. I bought the Kindle Fire primarily as an e-reader, with extra capability of watching streaming movies/TV shows and music--I don't intend to use it to surf the web. And so--it does what I want it to do. So far I have not actually purchased any Kindle books, but I have borrowed from the Amazon Prime Lending Library and also from my library via Overdrive. Checking books out and getting them to the device is very easy. The standard settings for font, size, etc. have worked very well for me thus far, and turning pages is very easy with the touch screen. I like how the orientation of the books on the device changes too, so you can hold it either horizontally or vertically.<br /><br />For watching movies, while the screen is (of course!) smaller than a computer or TV, the color and definition is excellent and I have had no problems with the connection issues or the media stalling as some have reported--perhaps more an issue with the wireless connection than any fault of Amazon itself? Not sure. One thing I do like is that if I stop the show on my Kindle Fire midway through, then resume watching on my TV, it 'knows' where I left off and resumes there. The sound seems fine to me--I primarily use with headphones, though.<br /><br />I've downloaded several free apps for weather, calorie counting, a few simple games, MapQuest, etc. and those work quite well. The color is vibrant and I haven't had any issues with clumsiness of the touch screen when using those.<br /><br />I have done a little connecting to the web, mostly to see how it worked, and if there is a fault, this would be it--the webpages are not that easy to see, with much scrolling needed, and pressing radio buttons and such are awkward with my larger fingers. It's hard for me to type on the keyboard--I think a stylus would make it much easier, but it's not anything I didn't expect given my larger hands, and also similar problem to when I have tried using the smaller keyboard on a laptop computer or on the QWERTY keyboard of my internet-connected HD TV. Not sure that there's any way to correct that problem. Since I don't plan to use the Kindle Fire for much web browsing this really isn't an issue for me--it's nice to have the capability to check e-mail and such when really needed and away from my regular computer, but not something I will use it for regularly.<br /><br />So far I love it and have really no complaints, but then I didn't expect it to work just like a full-service computer, either.not anything I didn't expect given my larger hands, and also similar problem to when I have tried using the smaller keyboard on a laptop computer or on the QWERTY keyboard of my internet-connected HD TV.

"B0051VVOB2","3","9","2","Amazon announced a system upgrade to 6.2 on November 29th.  Today is December 6th and I received my Kindle Fire which was ordered on December 4th with the 6.1 system version.  I am unable to connect to my wireless router which has multiple devices connected, is fully updated and restored to factory defaults, so, I can't update to 6.2 to see if I can achieve connectivity (*blink*).  I have no usb cable to connect the Fire to my computer because it seems to require an extra small one.  There are numerous threads on numerous forums commenting on connectivity issues with the Fire which may or may not be resolved by 6.2.  In order to determine this I will need to pay more money for a usb cable or go looking for a wireless connection that works, which I guess means Star$$'s which is irritating because I think their coffee tastes burnt.  Thanks Amazon for reminding me to always wait for the second roll-out of any electronic device.  Let's do this again next year, okay?  Not.  Edited, January 18:  Maybe some of you found this review unhelpful but I didn't.  I got a phone call from Amazon support offering to help because they saw this review.  I appreciate that.  Unfortunately, like many others the solution that ended up working was to purchase a new router.  I really didn't want to do that because there was nothing wrong with the old.  The combined cost puts me close to iPad territory, financially.  I kept the fire and have used it.  It is heavy and the battery doesn't last long but it has had some usefulness on trips.

I am not an \\""Apple guy\\"", but I'm not a hater either.  The Ipad is a wonderful device.  But at 500 bucks on the bottom end, it's not for everyone.  The build quality of other Android devices really hurt them, including the 101 and the Gtab.  My personal favorite is the Acer Iconia, but you are still talking DOUBLE the price of the Kindle Fire.  So it's really hard to beat at 200 bucks.  It has some glaring limitations, but has a lot of pluses as well for the price point.  Basically, if you want to spend 500-600 bucks, get an Ipad.  If you want Android's premium tablet, get an Iconia, Galaxy Tab 10.1, or the Xoom, etc.  If you want something around 200 or under, Fire is the best option for you.  Pros:  Design, Build Quality, Screen quality, Amazon integration, Simple interface, Netflix App, can hold in one hand, good for reading (although not in direct sunlight), will fit in your pocket (most men or larger pants), decent battery life.  Cons:  Screen smaller than I would like for watching movies, both speakers on one side of device when watching in landscape mode (the way you watch all videos), no SD card slot, no camera, no gps, no HDMI out, no Google Marketplace (although you can sideload some apps and there's an Amazon AppStore), no physical volume buttons or home key, low storage amount.

If you download an Ebook it is found under BOOKS, but if you move an Ebook from your PC it goes under DOCS ...   If you download a Video it is found under Video, but if you move a Video from your PC it goes under Gallery as a picture ...  Does not make sense ...    You can not remove items from the Main Screen ... ex: If you delete a Book it still shows up on the main screen...

We had to take it to a IT tech to set up email, Amazon (it defaulted to my Prime account and it had to be reconfigured for hers), Netflix, etc.  A real, and expensive pain.<br /><br />Then the real problems began.  She re-set her password on one email account and the Kindle shut down both of her email accounts from different providers.  She had to contact Kindle online and ask for a phone call.  After a 20 minute call....and then being put on hold until her cell battery went..still no help. Online to help sites and she finally got her email back.  So angry she refused to use the device for days.<br /><br />Since then, the screen will no longer rotate when she rotates the device.  Everything has to be viewed in the 'upright' position.  This cuts off some of the things she wants to view and makes watching video ridiculous.<br /><br />And, when she reads an email and hits the 'back' button....the Kindle takes her to her Linked-In account and she has to re-enter her email to read the next in line.<br /><br />A piece of crap.","0.032","0.887","0.081"

I'd be sitting at a Starbucks, not really enjoying the coffee (but having to pretend that I do to fit in), nervously fingering the heel-strap of my sling-back pumps, trying to make conversation with my friends, who all have their heads lowered toward their iPHONES as if in prayer. In those instances, I just whip out my handy-dandy... paperback novel. I've just never been the sort of person who was into gadgets and gizmos despite barely hitting my late-twenties. So, of course, I was tentative about stepping into the tablet market for the first time and needed something that was inexpensive (for a Receptionists' salary) and virtually painless to use, so I could distract myself from my sucky desk job, something that would be inconspicuous if I wanted to read at my desk during a lull in the afternoon.<br /><br />After four months of deliberation (reading hundreds of reviews), I went for the Kindle Fire HD, and I have to say, I don't have much to complain about. I don't have any issues with the screensaver, nor the carousel, nor the \\""What Others Bought\\"" adverts streaming on the bottom half of the screen. None of that bothered me at all.<br /><br />Anyway, it is very easy and addicting to use for a dummy like me.

"B0051VVOB2","3","3","2","Several reviewers expressed concern that anyone can purchase products on the kindle with the one click function..this is only if the one click function is turned on..to turn it off, one needs to click on \\""your account\\"" on the right hand corner of the amazon site..under settings, click on \\""1 click settings\\"", then make sure one click ordering is turned off on the right hand side..this can be done from the kindle fire, but it's much easier from a PC..once turned off, you will need your amazon password to make any purchases..  For password protection, just click on the little wheel in the top right hand corner of your device..then click \\""more\\"" and \\""security\\"", then lock the screen and create a password..now everytime you turn your kindle on, you'll be asked for your password..  Another major issue has been with the button at the bottom of the device..well, it does not have to be at the bottom..the device works just fine with the button at the top, or on either side, left or right (and of course at the bottom)..  So I really like this device, but like many other reviewers, have found several flaws, some big, some small..the biggest one is that the carousel cannot be customized and that all content and apps end up here and cannot be removed..I hope amazon quickly fixes this problem..another one that many have not mentioned is that the screen is very susceptible to fingerprints..and physical volume controls would have been great..not letting people upload personal content to the cloud is also lame..after all, this is not a free device, in which case amazon may have had some reason to restrict content..I hope this policy is changed soon..  For $200 it's a great device that will only get better as some of the glitches are fixed. It has potential to be a 4 star or even a 5 star product, but it needs to improve.","0.143","0.815","0.042"

I was looking at a few different tablets and this one has what I was looking for.  It is so easy to figure out, I can download books and movies with ease, and even shop amazon.com for other things.

"B0051VVOB2","5","8","3","I am an over the top pleased owner of the old plain Kindle with Keyboard, and I use it exclusively for reading - I just can't tell you how thrilled I am with it, in ALL respects, without belaboring the point, except to say that I am just so pleased with it to be able to select from an awesome selection of very reasonably priced books, to have them automatically downloaded almost instantly, to be able to read them easily in any lighting situation, and when I close a book down, or when its  closed down automatically after a predesignated period of non use, I can open it up very quickly and take off just where I was!  WOW!!!!!  And overall, I am absolutely an Amazon fan, making almost all of my product purchases (except gasoline, groceries, and prescription drugs) from Amazon.  I purchased the Kindlefire, for, among other things, to use as a movie viewer - I am a subscriber to Amazon's Excellent Prime Service, as well as to Netflix. I have four computers I own that when connected to heavily encrypted wi-fi provide all the convenient movies I would like to see.  And for a 40 inch LCD and a 109 inch front projected screen, Amazon's Hi-Def Streaming can't be beat.  So you see how happy I am with Amazon, and my reaction to the Kindlefire is absolute delight, in being able to download the aforementioned movies to it, to watch while sitting in airports, waiting rooms, etc.    I also have the competing Barnes and Noble Color Nook running an advanced Android OS - In terms of loading times, convenience and user friendliness, the Kindlefire wins in all and many other respects!","0.198","0.802","0.0"

Also, it would be helpful to have a scrolling funciton, like on my HTC Desire.  There have been quite a few times where scrolling a web page or a comment is difficult to pinpoint where you want to with your finger tip.  A scrolling sensor would be great or even on screen arrows that pop up like the keyboard.  Aside from those 2 issues that I have, I love the Fire.  I love that I can take my apps and web and books with me where ever I need to.

"B0083PWAPW","5","2","1","I have been, and still am, a roughly equal user of Microsoft, Android, Apple, and Amazon/Kindle products; and my background prior to retirement was in hi-tech.  Recently, I upgraded from a 3G Kindle with keyboard e-reader to a 7\\"" Fire HD.  It was the easiest transition I have ever experienced with any software and Internet based product.  The HD has very much impressed me in all areas except one-- i.e. side-loading of iTunes songs (but I expected that to be a challenge).  True, the HD has a limited, front-facing photo camera (i.e. only a single camera for Skype-like video conversations and basic photographs that are fairly clumsy to execute).  This is the primary feature differential between the HD and the Apple iPad Mini-- which does have dual photo cameras.  However, that was not something I cared about.  At the time of my purchase, the HD cost only $149 at OfficeMax, Amazon, and Best Buy; compared to $329 for the Mini.  In several key areas, the HD out-performs the Mini.  I will not detail these areas because comparisons are readily available on several websites.  For a great orientation to the HD (or to any product) I recommend watching a YouTube comprehensive video by Lisa Gade of Mobile Tech Review.  The feature that really sent me over-the-edge in a positive way was the text-to-speech (TTS) / read-to-me / professional narration / audio book option-- call it anything you like, I love it and use it often.  And, the sound from the dual Dolby speakers is high quality.  The e-reader functions and the video quality are state-of-the-art industry tops.  Many other reviewers fuss that Amazon has limited the available Android apps and/or that Apple has a greater quantity of apps.  This may well be so, BUT just how many hundreds of apps does one actually need or use?!  I easily found a FREE app for every function I require.  Amazon offers various options for syncing and backing-up your existing and new data (docs, books, songs, and so forth), the options are well thought-out and work in a flawless, simple manner. The HD handles Wi-Fi with excellence and is fast in executing all applications.  As a closing comment, I'll mention that I found a favorably rated magnetic case as well as screen protectors on Amazon.com from other vendors for a fraction of the price of official Amazon accessories.","0.148","0.837","0.016"

"B0051VVOB2","1","15","2","This Kindle \\""Fire\\"" device has been nothing but a disappointment. First, it's slow, painfully slow, agonizingly slow -at every task. Second, the touch-screen functionality is as terribly buggy and not only for web pages and games, you have to be VERY careful about turning pages in a book as well!. Third, if the battery gets below 90% you can kiss all Internet functionality goodbye. Finally, on day 45 (15 days after Amazon would have to take it back) it developed lines at one end of the screen, one red one and a blue one -they are visible through every application.<br /><br />They should have hired at least one person to test these devices before selling them to their customers.<br />I despise Amazon for what they have done to the Kindle identity with this device, it's an embarrassment.<br /><br />I was NOT expecting an iPad for $200 but I was expecting this device to AT LEAST be capable of the meager functions that Amazon claims for it!<br />The entire product description page (in my very recent experience) is a long list of lies. But don't take my word for it, THROW AWAY $200 on your own,<br />then get feel humiliated, and write your own review.<br /><br />This:<br /> [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]<br />is just so much deceit.<br /><br />Amazon should pull this trash from the market and refund our hard earned cash to all of us saps who bought one.

There are some new cool things, but a few things that I feel are downgrades from the original Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I was a happy Kindle Fire user, (was given the original Fire as a gift) but I was having some battery charging issues which I mentioned to my husband. Being a good husband, he got me this new HD Fire to take its place, handy since there was nothing Amazon customer service could do since I was out of warranty.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great resolution. Yes, the pictures look great. For my videos though this turned out not to be such a huge advantage, since I don't feel like paying an extra buck for HD. SD is nice, but not spectacular.<br />Sound. AMAZINGLY better than my old Fire.<br />Size. I am just really fond of this size. Fits in most of my purses, easy to pack, enough extra space over the original Kindle to make videos nicer, I like it. Good size.<br />Keyboard. Improved from the original. Easier to type, correct typos and less weird predictive text errors. Particularly love the little cursor like thing that you can easily slide around to get to where you want to fix a typo.<br />Skype Camera:  I am never going to use this as a camera, but needed something to Skype/Video Chat. So happy to have this feature, but I have to admit I have not tried it yet.<br />Feels and looks well made.<br />Cons:<br />Locks up! It has locked up at least 4 times so far, and if the charge is low, just won't turn on after it locks up unless I leave it to fully charge. My old fire could be brought back to life pretty easy, I could drain the charge and then plug it in and in a few minutes be back to reading my book. Might be a clue as to why my old Fire finally quit wanting to charge, but I got used to that convenience.<br />No Google Apps. The selection of Amazon apps is really bad. I could easily get Google Apps on my old Fire. I know there are ways to get around this,but I don't want to mess around \\""side loading\\"" and doing other tech type stuff I don't understand. I would really like to have some of my google apps here. Come on Amazon.<br />Loses WIFI connection easily, and then locks up. That could be a WIFI network issue but I just didn't have that problem with my old Fire. So I would have to download videos to watch those easily, and there isn't that much storage. Cuts down on the usefulness for me, this device is a pure entertainment device for me, and I needed it to be a little more robust and a little more user friendly.<br />I could have wished for more for what my husband paid.<br />UPDATE: June 11, 2013<br />I continued to have charging problems to the point that Amazon replaced the unit and gave me a credit to get the recommended charger. With the new unit, I am still having charging problems, the charge indicator says there is no charge, then I turn it off and on and it says it is fully charged. At least it doesn't \\""lock up\\"" like it used to, it will turn on. I have taken to not keeping it in a case, being superstitious about a comment from the help desk, asking me if I had it in a case.<br />the lack of a flash player app is keeping me from enjoying many of my favorite internet sites. (online magazines for instance) I did manage to sideload the flash player, following directions I found online, used the flash player once, and then when I went back to use it again, it wouldn't work.<br />The WIFI problem has basically disappeared with the new unit.

I bought the Google Nexus 7, but had to send two (2) back because of build quality (screen kept popping off).  So, I broke down and bought the Fire HD.  I can't help but compare it to the Nexus 7...outside of the build quality issue, the Nexus runs circles around the Fire HD, but the build quality is much better. The constant sales banners and recommendations are more annoying that I thought they would be.  It is fast, the picture is amazing, but just too wide and heavy for what I was wanting.  Guess I will wait on ASUS to fix the Nexus 7.  This is a great tablet, just not handy enough for me.  I don't understand the bezel size, yes it needs to be held at times by the side, but wow, really this big?<br /><br />Note:  It does not natively play AVI or WMV.  Will play MP4.","0.124","0.757","0.119"

"B0051VVOB2","3","6","3","I must say that I am quite disapointed with my experience so far. The device has been really good but there have been a few things that I've had issues but by far my worst experience has been with the customer service reps.   Issue 1 - fetching email via push doesn't work. The email app doesn't fetch emails unless I have the app open which is basically manual. (defeats the purpose of fetch). The customer service rep says that \\""this device is not meant to handle multi tasking\\"". This is truly a lie since I can use pandora and browse the web, among other things. CS just made something up. An android gingerbread device can obviously multi task.  Issue 2 - I have  6.5 gigs of usable space in the device, but if I use any more than 5 gigs, I get a warning that i'm running low on memory and doesn't allow other programs to access internal memory (1.5 gigs, seriously...my pc doesn't warn me until 50 megs or so but the kindle is so high powered that it needs all this space). At any rate, the customer service guy says \\""1 gig is exclusive for amazon.com content\\"". This absolute makes no sense considering I've never heard anyone say this before. And I don't think it's legal for you to limit the space for your own content. If it where I'm sure Apple would only let you fill the ipad with \\""purchases\\"" from itunes, which isn't the case.  I don't appreciate being told false responses to get me off the phone. Frankly amazon should have tested this device a lot more before releasing. Also, they should train their CS people a lot better so they can actually give you an answer not just a way to end the call.  The device","0.059","0.874","0.067"

It was the most important app for me but they stopped working with the Kindles. When I contacted them, they told me it was a decision made by Amazon. Bummer!

It's a little disappointing that you can't customize backgrounds and the lock screen like you can on other tablets, and the carousel takes some getting used to at first, but those are very minor issues.

It works just fine as a reader, I also have a Kindle Keyboard, but beyond that it is lacking... I had hoped that Silk was something that would improve browsing, instead it turned out to be the most kluberish excuse for a browser I have experienced.

This is a perfect device for someone that really wants a reader for books and magazines and the capability to watch TV shows and movies.  This is not really a replacement for a computer or if you are really looking for a tablet.  I downloaded the upgrade for the Nook Color so I could see the video capability, but really NetFlix and Hulu Plus were the only things available.  If you've been on NetFlix, you know the selection of movies for streaming is not good.  For less than the 12 monthly payments to netflix, join prime with so much more to choose from.

"B0051VVOB2","4","1","1","Kindle Fire is my first device which in learning its functionality by following instruction was simple enough to do. I began by attempting to download apps and a couple of books.  I ended up buying an unwanted book.  I haven't figured out how I managed to put this book in my cart. There are a couple of features I dislike in using the Kindle Fire. One is the short life of the battery when the Wi-Fi is turned off. Another is being careful how the tablet is held. If a finger touch the side it will flip pages. Several times I had to use the back arrow to return to the page I was reading. It had flipped towards the end of the book and it took several minutes to get back to my page. By tapping the home icon to start over will only return to the last flipped page.  Turning the tablet off and then on, will automatically open to the last page it had flipped to. There may be a way to return to the last page read which I haven't learn yet - when I accidently flip pages. I recommend Amazon make a fix by ONLY using the right or left arrows to turn pages, rather than by tapping or touching the side of the page, although this is handy. Also, instructions could be more definitive.  Being in my seventies and learning new technology is very trying. Reading the Kindle Fire is easy. I have learned to flag the page I am reading. Also to remove the flag when I began reading again. Flagging pages work for me. I have learned to hold my Kindle Fire by laying it in my hand and only touching the side when ready to turn a page. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful little tablet.  I would give it a five star if the battery life would last more than part of a day.","0.057","0.892","0.052"

"B0051VVOB2","1","77","44","This is a one-star review because Amazon doesn't let you give zero stars.  I was so excited to buy the Amazon Fire. I pre-ordered it the first day it went on sale. I have an iPad but I was thrilled to have a device that would access Amazon Prime Video as well as my Kindle books. The Fire arrived today and I couldn't wait to open the box and check it out. That was over 2 hours ago and every moment since then has been an exercise in frustration.  My Kindle refuses to register. Although it is connected to Wi-Fi and will go online, every time I attempt to register, I get an error message. I just spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support, and nothing has been resolved.   One of the tech people I spoke with decided the problem was that the Kindle software needed to be upgraded to 6.1. No problem. She waited while I downloaded the file and then I disccovered there's no USB cord included in the box. Okay, no problem. I'll use one of the half dozen usb cords I have around the house. No. It has to be the Kindle USB cord. Software updates are necessary for this device and those updates require a proprietary USB cord, and Amazon chose NOT to include that cord with the device?? How cheap can you be, Amazon?  So after working my way through 4 different people, the end result of the call was \\""sorry, we can't figure it out. You're going to have to give us a few a days to see if the engineers can find the problem.\\"" That's not a joke. That's actually where they left things.  I'll be sending it back tomorrow if I don't throw it against the wall first.  Update. Just got an email from Amazon asking if they'd solved my problem. Seriously??

I also wanted the larger screen and access to the Apple apps I was already used to.  The thing is... I love Amazon.  I have shopped Amazon for years, and they have made Christmas shopping a snap for years now.  I began to really look at the value of what Amazon was offering across the board.  Not just the tablet it's self, but with Prime and the integration with the Roku player (yeah, I got it the week before it went live on PS3, but it's ok).  I considered the fact that with Amazon's \\""one day\\"" offer I could get a Kindle Fire, Amazon Prime, and a Roku for under $300.  That is still hundreds of dollars from where I would need to be for an IPad, and I was getting a whole lot more bang for my buck.<br /><br />So I took the leap of faith... and I love it. Honestly I love the Fire.  It's a great little device!  Keep in mind though, it's an entertainment device!!  Watching movies on it is great.  Music and Books?  Outstanding.  Integration with Audible??  SO AWESOME.  The Audible app is the best thing to happen to my Audible account since I signed up.  Hello sleep timer based on chapters!  Added into the value of the device is my happiness with my Prime membership, and the outstanding little streaming device Roku, but those are purchases that are up to you.  I would say adding Prime to your Kindle purchase is a pretty good idea.

"B0051VVOB2","5","10","9","My mom just came back from her North American trip with a Kindle Fire. Before buying it, she was worried it wouldn't work here in the Philippines. After 2 months of waiting and reading ALL of the positive and negative reviews on the web, I told her to go for it. She didn't need any of those expensive tablets. All she wanted was something light and portable to bring with her when travelling. Just enough to check her Facebook and email accounts, surf the web, and maybe play some games and read a few magazines on. After having used it since last week, I can truthfully write that this is exactly what the Kindle Fire was built to do! I have to say, after setting the Fire up for her, I was really wanting one of my own.   The Silk browser is super fast. Not buggy at all, like what the other reviewers have noted. Reading blogs and articles on it has been really easy, and the display is fantastic! I've used an iPad, iTouch, and an iPhone before and the display is close enough that you wouldn't really expect a display so good on such a cheap tablet. I also got a few magazines for her to read (Architectural Digest, Everyday Living, Bon A Petite) and after 3 hours of reading the magazines and part of a novel in a room with a fluorescent light, I had no eye strain to complain about. My mom also tried reading the novel for a few hours and was really pleased with how easy it was to read from. She usually complains of eye strain after reading from her laptop, but she was very happy after reading from the Kindle Fire.  After reading a lot of complaints from different people about how a lot of Amazon's services not working outside of the US, I decided to try and see what exactly will and won't work from here in the Philippines.Let me first clarify that I did use a US credit card with a US billing address to make my purchases over a local IP address. To summarize the results of my experiment, cloud services for MP3's work, purchasing and downloading MP3's from outside the US work, cloud services for books and news stand works, purchases of books and from news stand works, streaming of videos DO NOT WORK outside of the US (but we already knew this before buying the Kindle Fire), purchasing and downloading of apps outside of the US ALSO WORKS. So for all those who are wondering, please read and re-read this paragraph again. If any of these are deal-breakers for you in terms of purchasing the Fire, then think hard. For us, these services were just bonuses since a lot of the things we wanted weren't tied to these services.   Regarding the apps available, I've already downloaded about 30 apps from Amazon and also from outside Amazon. Just by doing a little research on how to do it, I was able to load plenty of apps from outside the Amazon app market without any rooting. If you really don't want to use any of your mental faculties about loading apps, then spend the extra few hundred dollars and buy a more expensive tablet.  About the device itself, the dual-core chip is super fast and the touch display has a quick response time. The 7-inch display is great for us since it's just like holding a book. If my mom and I wanted a bigger display, we would be using our netbooks. The body is solid and it doesn't feel badly made. And for all those complaining about the power button being easy to accidentally pressed, just turn the display upside-down and problem solved. Personally, I never had any problems with the power button, and neither did my mom.  With how great the Kindle Fire is, my mom is planning to buy another one when she goes back to the US in a few months. This time, it'll be for me to use since I keep on borrowing her Kindle Fire. I can't wait!","0.112","0.828","0.06"

"B0051VVOB2","5","6","6","I did much research before choosing the Kindle Fire. I was at first drawn to the iPad, of course, because of all the hype. I went to the Apple store and played around with it - it's shiny with lots of bells and whistles. However, I chose the Kindle Fire and I don't regret it.<br /><br />The most obvious upside to this choice is the money saved - $200 for the Kindle Fire vs. $500+ for an iPad.<br /><br />Other benefits:<br /><br />Movies and TV: As an Amazon Prime Member, I'm enjoying free instant streaming movies and tv shows on a daily basis. The quality is excellent; I was blown away by the first video I watched. The streaming is great. I haven't experienced any lags or freezing issues. If you have a NetFlix account, movies stream well from the NetFlix app as well.<br /><br />Decent Battery Life: Battery life is good. You can easily get through a full movie without worrying about losing juice. It also charges fairly quickly.<br /><br />Weight: The weight of the Kindle Fire as compared to the newest (or even older models of iPad) wins hands-down. It's very light-weight and comfortable to use, whether in a sitting up or laying down in bed position. The Fire also appears to be a sturdy-build that you won't have to worry about.<br /><br />Surfing: No issues whatsoever while surfing the web.<br /><br />Ease Of Use: Even a novice will be able to use the Kindle Fire out of the box. If you need extra help, \\""Kindle Fire, The Missing Manual\\"" can be purchased for under $12.00. I think it's worth it because it gives you great tips for maximizing usage of the Fire.<br /><br />Extras: The pricing for books, movies, and apps is fantastic. You can easily add to your Kindle Fire without breaking the bank. Regarding books, I've built a 250+ library in only a few weeks for FREE. The free book downloads can't be beat! There are also countless books that are $1.99 and less. Movie rentals are less expensive than Pay-Per-View. Email, reading and saving documents, calendar, contacts - it's all here! The speakers are stereo and music/movies sound amazing!<br /><br />If you are looking for a tablet to create movies, photoshop work -- this is probably not for you and the iPad would be better equipped for that. However, if you want a good all-in-one tablet at a decent price for movie watching, reading, organizing, surfing the web, listening to music, go with the Kindle Fire! I'm very happy with my choice!","0.175","0.763","0.062"

"B0051VVOB2","2","15","7","Enough has been said about what it has done right, so I will only talk about three major flaws, and they are big ones!<br /><br />1. No Memory Slot:  You only get 1.17 GB for applications which gets eaten up real quick when you start downloading games, Facebook, Twitter, Weather and so on.  If you dip below the 250 MB your Fire's speed will be cut in half, and you will get a warning that you need to delete something to speed the Fire up, so you really need to subtract 250 MB as your Fire slows down and apps become unbearably slow!  THIS IS A HUGE FLAW in the Fire.  I am sure the Fire 2 will come out with a micro-sd slot, though.<br /><br />2. The App Store:  This is NOT the Android Play store, this is the Amazon Android store.  Apps usually are priced at twice the amount you can get them on your Android phone, this is simply not called for.  Also any App they may interfere with Amazon's business model will be blocked.  Amazon wants you shopping ONLY at Amazon!<br /><br />3. No Web Browser: The Fire does not allow you to use any browser but a modified version of theirs or a Maxthon Mobile Web Browser.  No Firefox, and No Google!  The Maxthon does run with the Google search bar, but Amazon's web browser always takes you to their shopping page.<br /><br />So there you have it, 3 MAJOR FLAWS, that the Kindle Fire should not have been released with!  There are some minor flaws like no camera, and no skype, and no IM'ing, but I use my Android for that, but I would use the Kindle Fire for those minor flaws as well, just out of convenience.<br /><br />So, unless the Kindle Fire 2 addresses the 3 Major Flaws, I will be going with some other type of E-Reader/Tablet, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 or 10.1","0.036","0.836","0.128"

"B0051VVOB2","5","20","17","I'm an Apple guy.  I wouldn't trade my iPhone for anything Android, nor would I trade my MacBook for anything PC.  So when Amazon debuted the Kindle Fire, I was skeptical.  Would it really deliver?  I waited until well after the Fire began shipping before making the decision to part with $200 (maybe a pittance to some, but not to me!).  I read reviews for days, and I kept going back and forth on \\""should I hold out for an iPad?\\""  In the end, I decided that the Fire was the tool for me and that I'd keep the extra $300 to buy diapers and baby food with.    In all the reviews I've read, I think that the common denominator on the poor reviews is that everyone expected an iPad-like product for a cell phone like price.  I know full well that the iPad has more functionality, more apps, more screen size, etc.  However, like many of the reviews I've read, if you don't need all that, then the Kindle Fire will blow you away.  It certainly did me.    As an e-reader, it's already replaced my Kindle keyboard, due to the simple fact that I can read late at night or early in the morning without turning on a light and waking up my wife.  And no crazy priced lighted case to have to worry about, either.  Books display well, and the features imbedded in the Kindle work great.  I certainly like typing notes much better than with the Kindle keyboard. No problems with weight or anything.  I hold it just like my old Kindle.  I really like the ability to see the books in the Carousel and the home screen.  Much easier to find than on the Kindle 3.  Yeah, having the ability to organize the books would be nice, but it's not that big a deal.  You can always click on the \\""book\\"" tab and go to the author view if you don't like looking at all your books as once.    Second, playing games (which my kids LOVE) is a blast on the larger screen, a huge step up from my phone.  No, it's not the iPad screen, but for $200, it works really well.  And who cares about all the apps not displaying in every screenorientation?  Have we really become so lazy that we can't flip it around?  And a free app a day is pretty cool, too.   Third, my experience with Silk and email has been good.  I'm not going to sit and compose major emails, or browse through a ton of web pages on this thing.  That's why I have a laptop.  But if I want to check something, or respond to a quick email, the Fire works great.    Fourth, the touch screen works fine for me.  Yeah, every once in a while it doesn't respond as quick and I have to tap again, but you know what?  My iPhone is the same way.  And yeah, every so often I fly past something in the carousel.  You know what I do?  I SLOW DOWN HOW I SCROLL.  Not that difficult, really.  As to the touchscreen keyboard, I've had no problems with it.  Maybe it's because I'm used to typing on my iPhone, but I wonder what people were expecting.  Touch screens on every device I've ever used are kind of hooky, including the iPhone.  And you know what?  Operator error enters in more than device error.  Fifth, the Cloud storage is great.  I've loaded quite a bit of music up, and the Fire streams it seamlessly.  Volume is good for a small device.  Haven't tried headphones yet, but will do that soon, I'm sure.  Video from Prime is seamless, too.  The combination of Cloud storage, free shipping, and free content will probably entice me to become a Prime member when the trial runs out.  Tough to beat for under $7 a month.   In the end, the Fire does everything I hoped it would do and it does it well.  I was struck when reading many of the reviews by much of the criticism that we are truly a spoiled people nowadays.  The Fire is not going to change my life, or complete me.  It's a fun gadget that allows me to do fun things in an easy and convenient way.  It's for ENTERTAINMENT, and  it does it extremely well.    The only thing I would seriously like to see change is the one-click option.  C'mon Amazon!  We WANT to put our passwords in to purchase!  It's not that big an inconvenience!  It's certainly easier than your having to deal with 100 cancellations and refunds when my kids purchase that Barbie Playhouse they've been wanting, but dad doesn't think they need!","0.19","0.725","0.085"

Kindle Fire is an Amazon consumption device, not a real tablet. If you want to browse internet, check e-mail, watch Amazon Videos, shop Amazon products, listen to music, read books/magazines etc it's a good device. But if you want to use Google products efficiently(G docs, G maps, G music, G voice etc), have additional storage options through SD card, use microphone for voice/video chat (Skype, G+) etc you might wanna check out other devices. I bought [[ASIN:B004U78J1G ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet]] for the real tablet experience and it's a very impressive tablet.  I'm dropping one star because it gave me problem with WiFi connectivity. Check out the video I uploaded.(Shot on December 10th. Hopefully they fixed this issue). In the video Kindle Fire tries to log into WiFi, then crashes and reboots going into an infinite loop of crash and reboot.

(For the record I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed these books on my kindle: Night Film (Marisha Pessl), World War Z (Max Brooks), Zone One (Colson Whitehead). I also read an advance copy of my sister's book, which I had read before but enjoyed even more on second reading on the kindle (another excellent tool -- your kindle can convert a PDF into a Kindle doc! So Cool! All you need to do is email the PDF to your kindle email with the word \\""CONVERT\\"" in the subject, and voila! It shows up in your \\""Docs\\"" as a Kindle-version of the PDF which is much easier read and navigated than a PDF). So, in short WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS THING NOW!***<br /><br />I was a little hesitant buying this having been a tried and true Apple fan. First though, I should explain that you REALLY want to buy this without the special offers. It's a little more money, but if you DON'T pay the extra, you see ads on the home screen every time you open up the device. So yeah, pay the extra to get rid of thes ads.<br /><br />As for the device itself, it is FAST. Like, the fastest operating system of anything in our house including my MacBook Pro, iPad or any of our iPhones. I LOVE reading on it too. The screen doesn't make your eyes ache like the iPad, and the text is really easy and clear to read. It is also super duper light weight.<br /><br />The only downside I've seen so far is there is no integration with Chromecast, which would be awesome.<br /><br />Overall though, really impressed with this little device, and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it. Do it. You won't be disappointed.ne considering buying it. Do it. You won't be disappointed.","0.194","0.756","0.049"

Know one had the parts to fix but could order.  However, all said that if fixed it would probably break again.  And the cost to fix was about half the cost of the tablet.  So now I have a tablet that I can't charge.  It otherwise do worked well.","0.037","0.937","0.026"
"B0083PWAPW","4","0","0","I bought it as a replacement for my old iPod touch. I figure why spend 200 dollars on another iPod touch that is the same small size with virtually no difference what so ever when I can spend the 200 on a well received tablet created by a company that I have bought from quite often. It was a no brain-er.<br /><br />As said in the description it is 7 inches in length and width. The speakers are amazing, The sound is very crisp and clear, Far better then the speakers of numerous computers that I owned (which cost me far more then this Kindle). The graphics are very good as well, Once again no complaints there. It's very easy to navigate through the menu and browse the various sections (Books, Music, Videos, Apps, etc...) and I have had zero problems connecting to the Wi-Fi either. The built in microphone and camera work great as well, It's perfect for skyping.<br /><br />Now to clear up something for other users about the battery and charging. I highly recommend keeping it off when charging because it charges a lot faster. I only have the USB cord and it's a huge pain considering it takes 5-7 hours to fully charge it. It is very annoying to charge it with the USB cord, Which is why I recommend buying the new plug in charger that Amazon has made. It's 20 extra bucks but it charges the device 3-4 hours, Far less then the 5-7 the USB offers you. Then again, Why didn't Amazon just add the charger in with the Kindle in the first place? I'd rather have paid a little extra to get a quality charger then to have a crap USB one that takes forever to charges. It's easily the worst aspect of the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I only have a few minor complaints about the Kindle outside of the terrible charging situation. Did not like that I can not use my gift card balance when ordering off the Kindle, I can only used a credit card or add a code for a recently bought gift card while I am checking out. Very annoying considering I only use gift cards to buy off from amazon.<br /><br />I amalso disappointed that it comes with nothing pre-loaded into it. At first it looked to come with A Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games, Angry Birds Space, and so on so forth and yet it came with none of that. Very misleading considering not only the product picture on amazon has it but it was also featured in the display at the Best Buy I bought the Kindle Fire at as well. Very misleading and very disappointing.<br /><br />Aside from that, It was a great buy and I highly recommend it.","0.109","0.747","0.144"

"B0051VVOB2","5","10","8","I cannot tell you how much I love my Kindle Fire. Words cannot describe. It is better than chocolate cake! Let me say, however, that I am also someone who has been forced kicking and screaming into the world of eReaders, handheld devices, etc. I still have a \\""stupid\\"" phone that only calls, texts (another trauma), and takes still pics! I could not make myself pay for an iPad and I just don't trust all those weird names out there on the digital market so as soon as I saw the Kindle Fire advertised, I signed up for one. It arrived before Thanksgiving and I sat up until 2 AM cradling it in my arms. I adore it. It is wonderful! The app store, while not iTunes worthy YET meets all my needs and has all my daughter's favorite games, the streaming movies are great, and I am a READER so I love all the Kindle edition books...especially the free ones! I can glut myself on text whether night or day now that I have this wonderful LCD screen. I know some people say it is heavy, but they are crazy! It is no heavier than a paperback book and the screen size is perfect for me too. Thank you Amazon! I love you that care enough about your customers to 1) develop this technology and 2) make it affordable. I hope you sells kazillions of these!","0.185","0.745","0.07"
"B0083PWAPW","3","79","67","I did quite a bit of research before I purchased this item, and I decided that I would give it a shot. It came out of the box decently charged, and once I got everything set up I was eager to look around and discover some goodies. I downloaded the Twitter and Facebook apps, which look AMAZING on the display, but my favorite social networking app (Tumblr) was nowhere to be found. I decided to just log on using Silk and found that I couldn't type anything into the login fields. After some quick Googling, I found out that I simply needed to restart the Kindle. That took care of THAT problem easily enough...<br /><br />Apps: Before I bought this, I was well aware that the app store was lacking, but I didn't really realize by how much. It was virtually impossible for me to find anything useful, and in some cases I would try to download something only to find it was incompatible with the HD. This became incredibly frustrating after about an hour of use.<br /><br />Carousel: This is a neat feature, but constantly removing icons from it was bothersome. It frequently added icons back after I removed them even if I hadn't used the app or read the book.<br /><br />Browser: I found that the browser didn't work very well for me unless I loaded everything in mobile view. This wasn't terrible, but it wasn't my favorite either.<br /><br />I had a problem with the page orientation changing and the slightest movement, but that was fixed by locking the orientation. I also had an issue with the physical glass screen pressing inward when I used a stylus. It just made the product seem poorly made and kind of fragile. I'm accustomed to using touchscreen devices, so I wasn't pressing particularly hard. The screen just appears to have some give.<br /><br />I found that the touchscreen was sometimes really sensitive, while at other times it barely registered a tap or swipe. This made playing games iffy, and sometimes I'd accidentally press links in the browser that I didn't intend to press.<br /><br />Oh, and the ads... There were some good offers, but I found the constant advertising a bit annoying. It wasn't intrusive, but it wasn't exactly subtle either.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed with the Kindle Fire HD. It isn't a bad device, but it isn't the device for me. I won't be shunning Amazon's Kindle line, but I would only purchase again after major improvements.","0.116","0.817","0.067"
"B0051VVOB2","5","5","4","I bought this item for my wife as a Christmas gift, and she absolutely loves it. She also has a Kindle Wi-Fi that she uses for reading many of her books, but having the new Kindle Fire with its crisp color display, and being able to access games, web sites, and magazine content is a great addition to her media consumption experience.  I was concerned about reviews that I had seen where people complained about the power button being on the bottom of the tablet, and causing them to accidentally turn their unit off. My wife discovered that the Kindle Fire orients the viewing content to what ever position you happen to be holding the unit in. So, from her perspective, the power button is ALWAYS on the tp of the unit. Problem solved.  One negative comment that I do agree with when reading other reviews is that the unit should have had a manual volume control. This is a significant design flaw, and having to locate and access volume controls via the screen is a huge pain and inconvenience.  Over all, I give this product a big thumbs up. Great value for the money. Available content is reasonable and vast, and it is easy to use. if you are looking for a great way to enjoy and use media content, but don't want to spend the money on an expensive tablet PC or i-pad, this is definitely a great alternative and a solid electronic device.","0.187","0.708","0.104"

"B00BWYQ9YE","5","6","3","I love my new Kindle HDX, however, the fiasco that ensued when it arrived did not leave me with a favorable impression. When it asked for our wireless password, we took it at it's word and tried to put in our password.  Many, many times and was stymied when it wouldn't take it.  And quite frankly, it should not be asking for a wireless password to our wi-fi in the first place because it wasn't asking for a PASSWORD, it was asking for the numeric code to access our wi-fi! Really, REALLY big difference!  My husband then called Amazon and was on the phone their, we're supposed to be computer whiz technicians, between 2 and 3 hours and they never figured out what the problem was either in it refusing to accept our password, which our internet carrier confirmed was the correct password. When my husband ended the call the Amazon techs finally told us to send it back, it was obviously glitched, massively and they'd issue a new one to me. However, somewhere about 3 in the morning,  my husband finally figured out the error on  his own and had it up and running on his own the next morning to my complete delight.  It's a huge oversight that when someone was putting in the coding in the first, that they made the unfortunate choice of words in &#34;password&#34; when the phrase should have reflected the numeric code for your wi-fi that it truly wants.","0.099","0.846","0.055"
"B0051VVOB2","2","16","8","I purchased the Kindle Fire this morning for my mother as an Xmas gift. I was looking for a device that would be easy to use with intuitive navigation and a clean layout. For the most part, the Kindle Fire fits the bill on these two requirements. However, the pre-loaded apps and bookmarks(IMDb, Amazon Store, ESPN, Craigslist, Pulse) that cannot be deleted, the mandatory credit card registration and the overall inability to truly customize anything is a real turn off. It brings me right back to the mid-1990s when every computer came with AOL and other bloatware that sucked up storage space and RAM and generally got in the way of how I wanted to use MY computer. While your Kindle Fire might have 8GB of total space, in actuality you have just under 6.5GB. I'm not interested in cloud storage and it's not something that would be convenient for my mother - for whom this gift was intended - as she does not have regular access to wifi.  PROs:  - I really like the size of the device, which is why I initially didn't go with the iPad. (Going to return this and probably going to go with the 7\\"" Galaxy Tab...after some more research..or maybe the iTouch.)  - Good physical design, especially the rubberized back.  - Decent interface design and navigation  CONs:  - I absolutely HATE the preloaded software...in principle and in terms of impact on device function. It sucks up storage space and clutters my app shelf with crap I would never, ever be interested in. IMDb, please!! Rotten Tomatoes is so much better!  - There is a noticeable delay in typing that can be frustrating when trying to bang out a search query or other text.  - The touchscreen itself seems a bit finicky - you might have to push several times and at different angles and degrees of pressure to get, say, the menu to appear or to return to the home screen  - Mandatory credit card registration. This is just ridiculous - it was Amazon's database that was hacked this past summer, compromising hundreds of thousands of users' credit card information (so says my bank rep). (I was on a business trip when I learned that my card had been suspended with a new one being mailed for security purposes). Why should I be required to make myself vulnerable to further data theft? If I want to purchase something through the Amazon store, I will happily enter my payment information each time. This - coupled with the bloatware - signals an overall lack of customer-centricity in Amazon's marketing and business practices...well, that may be a bit harsh. They do have a great return policy. But the bloatware and the mandatory cc registration really chap my hide.","0.105","0.781","0.114"
"B0051VVOB2","2","13","3","Amazon has always, in my opinion, one of the best companies with excellent prices, service and products. However, the kindle fire is truly a major.disappointment. I have owned it for two weeks now, and have been desparately hoping that it would slowly grow on me. Yet, I have to say, that I have become more and more frustrated with the product. Here are the reasons why:  1. The size itself is somewhere between an iphone and an ipad. It is too small to  feel comfortable viewing the content on this 7\\"" screen, while too big to hold it easily with one hand. It kind of falls in the middle of nowhere.  2. The keypad is not a user friendly one. The space bar and dot key are located way too close to each other, making it very.difficult to type smoothly.  3. The web browser is way too slow. I am not being unrealistic trying to compare with an Ipad or computer, but seriously, it is ridulously slow, making it a pain to surf the web or even something as basic as checking emails.  4. The apps are very limited. This has to do with Android's platform, which targets probably less than 15% of the smartphone/tablet market.  5. The fire gets very warm after just a 15 min use.  6. It also has a poor touchscreen sensitivity. It takes a couple of touches to get it going.  All in all, Amaazon, you have truly disappointed me this time!","0.085","0.816","0.098"

"B0083PWAPW","3","2","1","I purchased the v1 Kindle Fire, and loved it so much I purchased two more for family members. When I upgraded to the v2 HD version, I was thrilled, however, the love affair was short-lived.<br /><br />The Kindle does not have the same feel:<br />1. It seems to freeze often - not as bad as other people have experienced, but more than my v1 Kindle.<br />2. The on/off switch is hard to find - the cute little round button with the charging indicator light is gone. It has been replaced by a button that is flush with the case, and I can never find it easily.<br />3. I don't like the special offers or the &#34;if you liked [x], you may like [y]&#34; recommendations. I ended up calling Amazon to pay more to turn off the special offers because I found them obnoxious. For the recommendations, I eventually found out how to turn them off, but I should not have had to. Amazon has cheapened the Kindle Fire experience.<br />4. There are some sharp edges along the case that are not comfortable. My son and a friend also mentioned it.<br />5. The power outlet has been moved to one of the long sides instead of close to the power button. I don't know why, but every case available positions the Kindle so the power outlet is on the bottom while you are watching a movie. You cannot charge it while watching. You can try turning it upside down, but then the speakers are covered up. The power outlet should be returned to the side.<br />6. Other small nitpicky problems that just contribute to a user experience that is lower than the original.<br /><br />In the end, when you upgrade from a v1 to a v2, you would expect that things that worked in the v1 would stay the same, and the bugs fixed. In this case, the v2 actually created problems in functionalities that had been previously stable in the v1 - not good.<br /><br />I would return it, but my old Kindle has died (they seem to have a shelf life!), and I've invested too much in Amazon media to make a change now. I am, however, no longer singing the praises of the Kindle Fire. And I am not likely to buy another one.","0.091","0.795","0.114"

"B0051VVOB2","1","9","3","I pre-ordered the Kindle Fire and have been patiently waiting for it to ship.  Two weeks ago I noticed that it was now available through local retailers.  I figured, why not buy it locally and just cancel the Amazon order since it hasn't shipped yet?  I did so, but promptly received an email from Amazon saying that the order could not be cancelled because it is being processed.  It is now two weeks later, my Fire still has not shipped, but it is being 'processed' and the order will not be cancelled.  I've been told that I can refuse delivery once it shows up at my door step or can return it after accepting delivery, but that makes no sense.  I have been in contact with Amazon three times (email x2, telephone x1) and every time I got the same response.  If there is such a back order on the Kindle Fire I would think Amazon would be anxious to accept my cancellation so that they could use the Fire intended for me to fill some other standing order - especially since I am still buying their product, just not buying it from their site.    This rigid adherence to their stance, flying in the face of reason, has me questioning whether this is a site with which I would want to do business in the future.","0.084","0.817","0.099"
"B0051VVOB2","4","2","0","This review will be short. May update, after I have more time to play with it.  I just received my FIRE a couple weeks ago. I am enjoying learning more about the device as I go along.  I am a PC user as a primary device.I don't have an I Phone. Just a basic cell. I purchased this device. After sitting in a hospital waiting for a grandbaby to be born.Son in Law ,had an I PAD .That he was watching Netflix, while waiting. I held the device. And to me, personally. It was a bit too large and chunky for what I wanted.I wasn't looking for a ton of APPS.Just the ability to stream video when away from home.Read books on it.As well as have games that one of our grandbabies. (  5 yrs old ) could play.  I find the image/video quality to be very good. Volume could have been boosted somehow. So I have bought a headset to listen to movies on.( really wish that hadn't  been a necessity in order to enjoy this feature.)  Now when playing games on it.Not such an issue.Not sure as to why there is a difference between the 2 . Fully charged.Barely had enough battery life to stream one movie.We are talking 90 mins.Far cry from 7 hr claims with no Wi-FI connected.Thought would at least get 4 hours life while WI-FI connected.Only watching 1 movie before having to recharge is annoying.  Another issue/frustration,to me.The fact that Book Covers are always viewable.From the Main Screen. Versus having a way to private organizing them away from peering eyes. As some book covers are inappropriate for the 5yr old to see. Prefer to gave books/games/videos all set to separate tabs. That are password enabled.( Hope I am making the issue understandable)  As for the free PRIME Movies /streaming. I feel it has a very good variety of TV Shows as well as Movies. And the fact that it is included with a Prime Account. It also makes it a very affordable. Cheaper  than Netflix or Hulu Plus.Though this has apps for Netfix and others.It does not have an app for HULU Free.At least that I have been able to find.Another Book issue.Is when hooked to my PC.I am unable to sort the Book Titles by name. To back up onto my PC. ( this would be a way to temp remove book covers from being viewable to younger user of my device.)  All things considered.It is a great device for it's price.","0.108","0.865","0.027"
"B0083PWAPW","3","1","0","Hey All,<br /><br />This is my second Amazon Kindle Fire HD -- I purchased one around Thanksgiving and loved it so much that I bought a second one. The only issue now is that this second Kindle is working much slower than my first one -- even though they are connected to the same Amazon account and access the same Internet/WiFi.<br /><br />I spoke with Amazon for about 20 minutes on Friday, but was unfortunately disconnected on 3 different occasions due to phone issues they were having. The one rep did call me back like 30 minutes later, but I was still in the office and unable to continue the conversation at that time. They said it might be the software or my Internet connection -- but I do not believe that either of these are the case. I will need to call them back when I get a chance this week to hopefully resolve the situation.<br /><br />This is really my first issue with an Amazon product or their customer service. Overall, I love the Kindle Fire HD (at least my initial one), and it actually made me stop using my iPad 2 completely (and not just due to its smaller size).  I will be providing an update rated and review once I resolve what is going on with this specific device -- I hope it will not be too burdensome to handle this, but will keep you posted on that as well. Good luck!","0.178","0.783","0.04"

It appeared to be a loose charging port issue.<br /><br />Even though the Fire was out of warranty, I had read many stories online stating that Amazon was aware of the manufacturing defect, and would authorize a 1-time replacement at no cost as a gesture of goodwill.<br /><br />I had to escalate through three supervisors, but I am happy to say that my mother's free replacement kindle is on it's way.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon, for being reasonable when handling this defect.","0.109","0.768","0.123"
"B0051VVOB2","1","18","12","I was really looking forward to getting the Kindle Fire. I wanted it for browsing, for music, for books, etc. I don't need an iPad--nor do I want to spend $600. On the other hand, I want reliable WiFi access. This thing is testing my hatred for returning things. It drops my WiFi connection so often I feel like throwing it into the trash. Why produce a thing with such promise and send it out with such a debilitating flaw? Every other wireless device I use has a very simple set it and forget it wireless setup. This one pretends to have that--but it lies. It allows you to set it, and then, guess what? IT forgets it! Hah! One second I'm connected, the next I'm not. Great! The whole rely on the cloud thing kinda goes out the window when I CAN'T STAY CONNECTED.  I don't have this issue with any other device I use. I have the latest update. How can they talk about streaming movies and music using a device that could cut out at any moment?  Did no one test this thing before sending it out the door?  The only reason I am not sending it back (today) is that I am lazy when it comes to returning things, and stupidly optimistic that, maybe, it might just work right, someday. . .  I feel like I've been scammed.  01/20/12  Well, I've had it for about one month and Wi-Fi still comes and goes. Talk about buyer's remorse. One of the reasons I bought the Kindle was to reduce the number of devices I have with me in our living room--to avoid using my laptop or iPhone for simple browsing. Well, I still have to keep both nearby because I can't rely on the Kindle to maintain it's WiFi connection.  Even as I write this I am thinking about browsing around for another tablet.

"B0051VVOB2","2","18","8","[[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]  I've been an Amazon Kindle user since the original Kindle 1 and have owned all the major subsequent models. I still use the Kindle 2 and my wife swears by the Kindle 3. So, we've looked to the Kindle Fire with great anticipation, since it would let us read now in poor light without having to use Kindle iPad apps. The first surprise when I started up the Kindle Fire was that I'd have to re-download all my currently active books. This means searching throughout the hundreds of books in my archive and is a nuisance but not a serious problem.  The second surprise was that previously purchased Kindle applications could not be downloaded to the Kindle Fire; it just can't run them. This was a deal-breaker for my wife, who enjoys playing word games between reading sessions. The third surprise was that the Web browser was slow and limited. The screen is too small for most Web sites and the system Amazon uses to render pages in the cloud does nothing to fit the content onto the screen in a legible size. So, forget Web surfing from the device. Fourth, there is no built-in email app that I could find.   Lastly, and most importantly,  I was shocked to see that the Kindle Fire was pre linked to my Amazon account with absolutely no control to limit access. Not only that, one-click shopping was preset even though I've studiously avoided it for the past eight years and always turn it off whenever Amazon tries to inveigle me into it. It's just too easy to push a wrong button. And if I lose my Kindle Fire, my account becomes accessible to anyone who finds it. This will make Kindle Fires prime targets for thieves. I thought Amazon was more considerate of our wallets and our privacy. I have items in my shopping basket that I'm considering as Christmas presents; I don't want my wife to have easy access to those.  So, I'm disappointed and have decided that life without the Kindle Fire will be easier than life withit. Back it goes!  At least Amazon is very considerate in processing returns. :-)","0.149","0.717","0.133"

"B0051VVOB2","1","14","2","Good morning,  Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback on the two Amazon Kindle Fires i procured for my 7 & 10 year old.  We now reside reside in The Gambia in West Africa after 27 years in the USA.  We were very excited to get the kindles and unfortunately there are too many restrictions to access software because of the geographical location we reside in.  Below is an excerpt from Amazon.  We would like to return the product and purchase ipads in lieu due t0 the restrictions.  We will also need some type of extended arrangement as shipping these items from here takes a while due to the distance.  We thank you for your cooperation.  I'm so sorry for the problem you faced while purchasing games for your Kindle Fire devices. Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience this situation may have caused.  RESPONSE FROM AMAZON  \\""I'd like to inform you that at this time, we're unable to offer the Amazon Appstore for Kindle Fire and associated apps to our international customers\\"".    Amazon Appstore for Kindle Fire content can only be purchased, downloaded, and upgraded by customers connecting to the Internet from a location in the United States specifically the 48 contiguous states, Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.

"B00BWYRF7E","3","0","0","On the Kindle HDX product page, just under the area where you choose your options, is a heading which says \\""We want you to know...\\"" (If they really wanted you to know, I think this would not require clicking on \\""Learn more\\"".)  This is where I first heard about the blue haze. Here's a quote from that section:<br />______________________________________<br /><br />To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.<br /><br />As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.<br /><br />______________________________________<br /><br />The blue haze is unacceptable. On anything with a lot of white background (like books), the blue isn't just around the edges, but is also on areas throughout the screen. This makes everything else look dirty, almost like a nicotine haze. I searchedj YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, and watched the video entitled \\""Kindle Fire HDX Blue/Purple Haze Screen Issue\\"" I could even see the same dirty looking screen issue on the one in the video.<br /><br />Amazon's thread about this issue can be found here: http://mcmx.in/1avGD3R<br /><br />Amazon sent me a second device, but it has the same issue. Further investigation on my part leads me to conclude that this is a defect, but not one for which Amazon has a solution, and is instead explaining it as an enhancement to provide superb graphics. I'm extremely disappointed. I really wanted to love this device, but with this issue, it's a subpar product, so I'm returningthe second one, too.","0.094","0.836","0.071"

For the most part, it serves that purpose. But that's about all the good things I can say about the Kindle Fire.  My complaints/disappointments:  - Slow response. Having an iPhone 4s, I can definitely feel the difference in lack of responsiveness with the Fire. On the Fire, it feels slow and laggy.   - Touchscreen is not precise. I have to press buttons more than once on many occasions; especially the smaller buttons inside apps. Trying to highlight text (for copy&pasting) becomes very difficult because I can't accurately position the selection cursor.  - Device doesn't come with a micro-USB cable to hook up to PC so you have to run out and buy one (unless you have one handy). Why not do something like the iPhone? USB cable + USB power adapter?  - Amazon Silk is not what it's cracked up to be.  Slow. Not impressive at all. And I use 802.11n at home.  - The device does NOT show videos you download to it. Only videos bought from Amazon appear in your Videos. BIG disappointment. MP3s, fortunately, do appear in your Music.  - Amazon Prime was a scam. If you've used your Prime Trial within the last 12 months, you don't get to try it out again. And it's only for one month... For some reason, I thought it was 1 year trial.  - Children's books (Kindle edition) cost a fortune! So why the heck does a Kindle Fire version cost more than print version?? E.g. \\""Brown Bear\\""  - Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't find the place to change the wallpaper images.  - Auto-zoom (when you double-tap an area in browser) is NOT intelligent.

"B0083PWAPW","3","2","0","I like the Kindle Fire, but I did have a problem logging on to the internet at my son's house. Others, who were there at the same time had no problems logging in with their devices. Chatted on the Kindle help line when I got home, and all they could tell me was to call them if it happened again.","0.079","0.747","0.173"
"B0083PWAPW","4","1","0","I love my Kindle Fire HD.  However, I do have one issue with it.  It keeps freezing up on me and I have to turn it off and wait a few minutes and then turn it on again.  This happens several times each time I'm using it.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with all Kindle Fires or just mine.  I do have a regular Kindle which I owned for over 2 years and never had this problem.","0.052","0.809","0.139"
"B00BWYQ9YE","3","2","1","I love my kindle. Initially I bought it to put textbooks on for classes but they ended up being cheaper to rent the actual book.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Speed - This tablet seems really fast. It has no trouble keeping up with some of the demanding games that I could find to use on it.<br />Simplicity - Not as simple as an apple device but much better than the regular android format on samsungs and whatnot.<br /><br />Image quality - SUPER clear screen. Not much more to say. Its sharp and bright and the color is wonderful.<br /><br />Sound - This is one of my favorite features. The HDX has 2 larger than normal speakers in the back of it. This give it VERY nice stereo sound. Its amazing the sound that comes out of this tablet.<br /><br />Size - It's a bit smaller than the iPad mini but in my opinion it's the perfect size. The iPad is a little to large to hold in one hand easily. I can hold the HDX with one hand in portrait mode.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Battery life - It isn't terrible but if you plan on playing games a lot it lasts about 5 hours otherwise with mixed use I typically get about 10 hours of use out of it<br /><br />Apps - This is by far the worst part of this tablet. With such an amazing device why would you limit it Amazon? Last I remember tablets are made to run apps. This is one of the most critical aspects of a tablet and the apps available SUCK! Some of the apps that I've been interested in have absolutely horrible ratings. Please get some decent apps available Amazon... This would have 5 stars all the way if the apps were fixed.","0.196","0.725","0.079"

"B0051VVOB2","3","10","2","I was pleased to purchase a Kindle Fire for my brother's birthday and paid for upgraded shipping to get the Fire to him in time for his birthday. I received an email from Amazon saying the fire had shipped, however UPS had not received the package or even so much as ha record that a tracking label was created--the kindle never shipped.  On the day it was supposed to arrive I called Amazon and was told that there was nothing they would do until 5 days AFTER the product was supposed to have been delivered. When I said that I had paid for upgrade shipping and wanted it refunded, since they failed to provide a service I paid for, I had to go through THREE supervisors to get the shipping refunded. And when they finally agreed to give me back my money, I was told that it would be a \\""one time\\"" courtesy. The also refused to send a replacement kindle until the 5 days had passed.<br /><br />5 days after the initial delivery date, the kindle still had not arrived. I called and had to speak to 2 more supervisors just to get someone to agree to send out a replacement. I was told, rather rudely, that if for some reason both Kindles shipped, I would need to bear the cost of shipping one of them back.<br /><br />Amazon finally agreed to ship the replacement, but I had to fight to get them to send it out next day (now a week after my brother's birthday).<br /><br />The product is alright--a cheap stop-gap between nothing and an iPad. Considering the customer service I received, however, I will not be purchasing any significant items from Amazon any longer.","0.062","0.886","0.051"
